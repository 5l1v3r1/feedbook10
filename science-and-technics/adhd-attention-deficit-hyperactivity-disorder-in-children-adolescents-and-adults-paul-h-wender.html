  <title>ADHD: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children, Adolescents, and Adults - Paul H. Wender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul Wender began his career treating children with ADHD 37 years ago and has treated adults with the disorder for almost 30 years. His exhaustive research and insight gained from clinical practice led to the first book about ADHD in children (Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children, 1971). Continuing research revealed that in many instances ADHD persisted into adult life, and that adult ADHD included symptoms that were not present in childhood. These findings resulted in his 1995 book Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults. He also authored the first book for the parents of children with ADHD, The Hyperactive Child in 1974. Now, in this revised and updated edition of ADHD he presents the definitive resource on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.       In his discussion of ADHD treatments, Wender stresses that drug therapy remains the most effective in treating the disorder. He adds, however, that psychological techniques, when combined with medication, can produce further improvement. Most important, Wender offers practical--and extensive--instructions on how parents of an ADHD sufferer can best help their child.       Throughout, Wender supplies extensive case histories of children and adolescents with ADHD, as well as accounts of the experience of ADHD in adults as perceived by both patients and their families. In addition, the book contains valuable information on where to seek help, as well as on the kinds of diagnostic tests currently available. Finally, in an appendix to the volume, the author includes instructions on how adults can self-screen for the disorder.        Now a classic work, ADHD grants parents and adults whose lives have been touched by this disorder an indispensable source of help, hope, and understanding." />

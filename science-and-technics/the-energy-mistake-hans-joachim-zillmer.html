  <title>The Energy Mistake - Hans-Joachim Zillmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In recent years the statement that crude oil and natural gas are running out has a profound influence on the world economic strategies and on world politics as well as on the future of all humankind. But is this scientific conception of the world totally wrong? This is a must-read book! The renewed interest in the planets that resulted during the 2000s from the space probe investigations caused by Hans-Joachim Zillmer to think about the origin of planetary bodies and the various volatile substances of their atmospheres. Scientists are surprised and have no lucid explanation that abundant hydrocarbons even occur on comets and as already proofed on other planets or its moons. In this book is described that this volatile substances on planetary bodies are not of biology origin. These inorganic components of the Earth&#39;s mantle are continually out gassing toward the surface by geological and mechanical forces. Our planet would be replete with methane and we are not running out of petroleum? The energy crises would be over. 
There are many other reasons for wanting to understand the principle of operation of our solar system with the energy supply of planetary bodies. Suppose someone claimed that life on Earth started below the surface of our planet and if we find extraterrestrial life it is likely to be within, but not on, other planets. Darwin&#39;s theory of macroevolution must be rewritten. 
This heretic science book rejects the ideas of conventional geology, geophysics and astronomy, but instead demonstrates in layman&#39;s terms how the Earth originated and where the continents, the ocean and the atmosphere came from. This highly exciting and controversial German bestselling book The Energy Mistake shows that the history of Earth must also be replaced. We see a brilliant thinker as he develops a revolutionary view about the fundamental workings of our planet and the solar systems. 
This is a must-read book" />

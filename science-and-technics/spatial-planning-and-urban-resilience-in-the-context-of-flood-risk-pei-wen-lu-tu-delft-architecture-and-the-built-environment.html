  <title>Spatial planning and urban resilience in the context of flood risk. - Pei-Wen Lu, Tu Delft, Architecture and the Built Environment</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Spatial planning is increasingly being considered as an important mechanism in coping with flood risk due to climate change. One of the reasons for this is that engineering approaches are increasingly expensive and cannot provide complete certainty of protection against climate-related floods. The thesis examines whether and how spatial planning is used in urban areas to promote resilience to flood risk and climate change. In this study, planning is considered as the regulation of physical implementation as well as the process of policy-making that guides spatial development. This process mainly involves the interaction and collaboration between actors (both public and private).&lt;/span&gt;

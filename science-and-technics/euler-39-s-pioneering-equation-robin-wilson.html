  <title>Euler&#39;s Pioneering Equation - Robin Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1988 The Mathematical Intelligencer, a quarterly mathematics journal, carried out a poll to find the most beautiful theorem in mathematics. Twenty-four theorems were listed and readers were invited to award each a &#39;score for beauty&#39;. While there were many worthy competitors, the winner was &#39;Euler&#39;s equation&#39;. In 2004 Physics World carried out a similar poll of &#39;greatest equations&#39;, and found that among physicists Euler&#39;s mathematical result came
second only to Maxwell&#39;s equations. The Stanford mathematician Keith Devlin reflected the feelings of many in describing it as &quot;like a Shakespearian sonnet that captures the very essence of love, or a painting which brings out the beauty of the human form that is far more than just skin deep, Euler&#39;s equation reaches
down into the very depths of existence&quot;.
What is it that makes Euler&#39;s identity, e]iPi + 1 = 0, so special?
In Euler&#39;s Pioneering Equation Robin Wilson shows how this simple, elegant, and profound formula links together perhaps the five most important numbers in mathematics, each associated with a story in themselves: the number 1, the basis of our counting system; the concept of zero, which was a major development in mathematics, and opened up the idea of negative numbers; ? an irrational number, the basis for the measurement of circles; the exponential e, associated
with exponential growth and logarithms; and the imaginary number i, the square root of -1, the basis of complex numbers. Following a chapter on each of the elements, Robin Wilson discusses how the startling relationship between them was established, including the several near misses to the discovery of the formula." />

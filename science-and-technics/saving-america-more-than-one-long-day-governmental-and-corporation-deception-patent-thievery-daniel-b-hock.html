  <title>Saving America &quot;More Than One Long Day&quot;  Governmental and Corporation Deception = Patent Thievery - Daniel B Hock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our DEDICATION TO PROTECT has risen from my past rescues as a professional firefighter. My wife and I have innovated, prototyped, and patented, an alert system to allow safety concerns for our public and military. Many lives have been lost, and continue. With our patented innovation, our Country has regained recourse, by means of deception. Military operations, I truly believe, have led to the dispatching of many terrorists, and continue to improve with more actions. Our dedication has turned our device into an International success. Many companies, that were trusted interests, decided to eliminate our DESTINY, to call their own.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As more insightful innovations evolve, more volumes, to this book, will be created. With the fabulous return of our troops from overseas, the locating and destructing of the Taliban, I salute. If this meant the thieving of our patent, to achieve greatness, than I am grateful. Otherwise, stop the deceiving corporations and government . Our Country&#39;s children need our device today. I continue to be inundated with the screams of terror from abductions, torture, and death.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;OUR COUNTRY NEEDS THIS PROTECTION....not tens of thousands of unmanned drone planes following our cell phones..&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If our new cell phones are implemented with an Auto-Id, GPS Auto-Tracker microprocessor, I WANT TO KNOW. ( I believe, I already know) GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE...when did this stop?&lt;/p&gt;" />

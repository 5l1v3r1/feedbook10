  <title>The Science and Design of the Hybrid Rocket Engine - Richard M. Newlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a textbook about rocket engineering, concentrating on the nitrous oxide hybrid rocket engine, both small and large. It&#39;s also a book about the science of chemical rockets in detail: three of the chapters are full of in-depth rocket science describing how all chemical rockets work. After a first chapter brushing up on the science and maths you&#39;ll need, the book describes the choice and safe use of hybrid rocket propellants, and how they&#39;re handled in practice. Then there are the rocket science chapters. Then you learn how to design, construct, and operate, a large hybrid rocket engine capable of getting you into Space. The book also includes a practical guide to the testing of hybrid rocket engines large and small, and how to fly them safely. Included are full instructions for programming a rocket trajectory simulator in Microsoft Excel, and several appendices containing rocketry information and equations, and instructions on how to design a bell nozzle." />

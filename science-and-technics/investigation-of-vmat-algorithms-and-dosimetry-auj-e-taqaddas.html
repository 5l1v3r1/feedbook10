  <title>Investigation of Vmat Algorithms and Dosimetry - Auj-e-Taqaddas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the recent advances in Radiation Oncology and Treatment Planning is Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT).  The treatment planning and dosimetry is complex for VMAT. The distinctive feature of this book is in providing a concise discussion of different VMAT concepts in simple language without going into too much detail.  Another important feature of this book is that it includes an original Research Paper that compares  three different VMAT optimization Algorithms (SmartArc, Ergo++ and Autobeam) with one another and against current gold standard and describes the Dosimetry and Modelling.  
The first 4 chapters provide the knowledge base required to understand the basic VMAT concepts and the research study discussed in 5th Chapter. Furthermore this book explains the Control Point Modelling process so that readers can learn how to do it on their own.
The book is written to appeal a wider population including radiographers, students, physicists, dosimetrists and oncologists.  Plenty of references are provided for those who would like to do further research and have deeper understanding of the VMAT." />

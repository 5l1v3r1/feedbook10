  <title>Kanban Change Leadership - Klaus Leopold, Siegfried Kaltenecker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explains how and why Kanban offers a new approach to change in 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century businesses&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;This book provides an understanding of what is necessary to properly understand change management with Kanban as well as how to apply it optimally in the workplace. The book emphasizes critical aspects, several traps which users repeatedly fall into, and presents some practical guidelines for Kanban change management to help avoid these traps. The authors have organized the book into three sections. The first section focuses on the foundations of Kanban, establishing the technical basis of Kanban and indicating the mechanisms required to enact change. In the second section, the authors explain the context of Kanban change management—the options for change, how they can be set in motion, and their consequences for a business. The third section takes the topics from the previous sections and relates them to the social system of business—the goal is to guide readers in the process of building a culture of continuousimprovement by reviewing real case studies and seeing how Kanban is applied in various situations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Kanban Change Leadership:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explains how to implement sustainable system-wide changes using Kanban principles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Addresses the principles and core practices of Kanban including visualization, WIP limits, classes of service, operation and coordination, metrics, and improvement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Describes implementation, preparation, assessment, training, feedback, commissioning, and operation processes in order to create a culture of continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kanban Change Leadership&lt;/i&gt; is an educational and comprehensive text for: software and systems engineers; IT project managers; commercial and industrial executives and managers; as well as anyone interested in Kanban.&lt;/p&gt;" />

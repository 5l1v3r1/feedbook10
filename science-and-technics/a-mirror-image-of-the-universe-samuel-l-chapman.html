  <title>A Mirror Image of the Universe - Samuel L. Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story begins when eternity gave birth to time. The night was far-flung and astronomically wonderful when these giant bodies that we call stars were born. The stars are in galaxies of 100 billion solar masses that make up the Milky Way, which is just one galaxy among many. Chapman asserts that the universe, in its entirety, is a single organism with a complex structure comprised of countless trillions of organisms of lesser size. By asking you to really think about all he presents within the book, Chapman appeals to your introspective side, and he shows you how to understand the intricate details in all the twists and turns of the truth, which is obscured in this vast universe. 
If you are ready to look at our universe in a new and innovative way, The Countless Trillions of Universes within Universes can show you how!" />

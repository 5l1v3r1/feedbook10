  <title>Beloved Distance - The Separation That Connects Us to All - Kay Lorraine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in a world on fire.
Everywhere we turn, there&#39;s discord, strife, violence. Everything is falling apart, and the global suffering never seems to end.
What can we do?
Some say, we must eradicate separation and experience Unity, in order to step back from the brink of destruction. We must come together As One, and embrace our universal connection.
The problem is, separation is central to our human experience. We are separate beings, distinct from each other. And we constantly seek to distinguish ourselves from others, as part of our community-building work.
This book explores how we can embrace separation and distance as a vital part of our human lives. It asks us to look within - to the very structure of our cells - to find answers... and ultimately meaning... in the way we&#39;re built to connect.
Let&#39;s journey into the innermost workings of the amazing human body, and let it change our ideas about the outermost workings of the human species." />

  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Cal Newport’s Deep Work - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Summary, Analysis, and Review of Cal Newport’s Deep Work: Rules for Success in a Distracted World includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport is a self-help book that stresses the transformative power of concentration. The premise: today’s world is filled with distractions that lead to dissatisfaction and brain drain. With various forces on the internet constantly seeking to occupy your ever-dwindling attention span, you must fiercely guard the time you set aside for deep contemplation and thoughtful work. 
Fundamentally, knowledge workers have two modes of work: shallow and deep. Shallow work can take many forms. It can be busywork like meetings or work email. It can be task-oriented, like scheduling or paying bills. It can be undefined or even frivolous, like long sessions of unfocused internet surfing. The common denominator is that all of these forms of shallow work are undemanding and distracting, making frequent intrusions upon your work day (with email) or hijacking your attention (with social media platforms)." />

  <title>The Ultimate Guide to Team Building - Casey Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will encompass an important topic for any organization, Team Building.  It will serve as a simplistic, entertaining, yet strategic guide to effectively building successful project teams.  Consider this guide the unparalleled resource to achieving ultimate project success.  We will explore real world examples, lessons learned, and things to look out for when building project teams.  This guide will aid any manager, in any environment, to truly wrap their minds around the characteristics, objectives, and skills needed to effectively orchestrate and assemble a truly successful team.  It has taken many hours, months, and years of frustration in order to formulate the philosophies outlined in this self help guide.  I hope every leader, at every level, can relish in these philosophies, and use them to relieve the burden and frustrations that can accompany team formulation.
This guide will contain eight revolving steps which should be taken into consideration with any project.  Each step holds its own importance, and will be broken down and discussed in detail throughout this guide.  This guide is a building block to success as a leader, and each step is the support structure for them to become successful.  Effective teams are an important factor to any organizations ability to be successful.  To aid in the development and establishment of these teams is my intentions of this guide.  Hopefully, my contributions will one day modernize and simplify the ability to establish such teams nationally and potentially globally, through all types of corporations and business ventures." />

It is narrated by the eponymous Wife of Bath, a serial widow who frankly discusses her enjoyment of sex and the control she exerted over her husbands, which would have been seen as scandalous at the time. In the story she tells, a knight who has raped a young maiden is sentenced to death, but granted a last-minute reprieve: if he is able to discover what women want most within a year, his life will be spared. In the end, the knight does indeed find the answer: women most desire to be in control of their relationship with their husband or lover.

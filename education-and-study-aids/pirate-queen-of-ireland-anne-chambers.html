  <title>Pirate Queen of Ireland - Anne Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of Grace O’Malley, or Granuaile, who ruled on land and sea in Connaught over 400 years ago. A Pirate Queen and Chieftain, she became a legend. We meet Grace as a young girl on Ireland’s west coast. Her father is a strong chieftain and loves the sea. Despite her parents’ objections, Grace becomes a better sailor than any of her father’s crew and so the adventures of the Pirate Queen begin. We set sail on her galley to Spain where war with England affects Grace and Ireland. We meet her husbands, Donal of the Battles and Richard in Iron, and are on board ship for her son’s birth and pirate attacks. After many escapades we sail to London for her famous meeting with Queen Elizabeth I. And we stay with her in her castle at Rock Fleet where she dies in 1603. This non-fiction account is a must for children who love Irish history!  Similar to: Michael Collins: Most Wanted Man by Vincent McDonnell and Tom Crean: Ice Man by Michael Smith.&lt;/p&gt;" />

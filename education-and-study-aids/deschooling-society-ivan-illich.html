  <title>Deschooling Society - Ivan Illich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is a critical discourse on education as practised in &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; economies. Full of detail on contemporary programs and concerns, the book remains as radical today. Giving examples of the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Illich describes much of what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen come to pass with the internet and social networks (even if he does speak in terms of telephones and postal mail) and even mentions in passing game-based learning. His prescription however, is radical and thought-provoking: do away with schools entirely, and replace them with learning networks.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
This sentence makes clear what the title suggests &amp;mdash; that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The book is more than a critique - it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. In the direction of a real learning to what the individual and community needs." />

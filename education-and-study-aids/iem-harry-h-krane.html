  <title>Iem - Harry H. Krane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Australia the largest island continent in the world has now
broken the twenty-three million people population barrier. At
the end of World War 2 people whose lives were wrecked
through war, politics and racism, many of them displaced
persons, sought it out as a haven of freedom, refuge and
opportunities. There were also those who wished to escape
the ravages of poverty and bleak futures for their children,
many coming from Italy and Greece. Australia became a
robust multicultural society with some two hundred different
nationalities, all aussies.
Migration brings to the surface problems and hardships.
People domiciled in Australia gave assistance, yet even in
the seventies (evidently) much more had to be done. A small
group of people, both native Australian and migrants, wanted
to contribute towards alleviating the various distressing
situations. A paper was researched, and this became a
booklet called IEM English for migrants in Australia, widely
distributed to educators and governments. It contained
submissions and ideas that ranged from migrant language
education, social integration and telephone services to
ethnic Radio and TV. This publication contains the original
IEM booklet with expanded explanations to highlight its
contribution to the migrant story of Australia." />

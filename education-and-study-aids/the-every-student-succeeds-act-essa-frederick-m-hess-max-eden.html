  <title>The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) - Frederick M. Hess, Max Eden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In this foundational book, Frederick M. Hess and Max Eden bring together a cross-section of respected academics and journalists to examine key aspects of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; This volume provides a thematic and in-depth analysis of the central provisions of this landmark legislation, presenting a range of perspectives. The contributors&amp;mdash;leading researchers, policy analysts, and journalists&amp;mdash;explore the conflicts and compromises that shaped the emerging law, outline its core provisions, and trace its implications for urban districts, states, and the federal government. Complementing these descriptions are chapters presenting opposing viewpoints on the law&amp;rsquo;s merits and its ramifications for future reform efforts.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Enacted in December 2015, ESSA represents a major shift of the federal role in education, and its provisions touch on almost every aspect of education policy. Yet it arrived in something of a whirlwind, and scholars, advocates, and policy makers are struggling to make sense of this new act. By bringing together leading thinkers to make sense of this important law, &lt;I&gt;The Every Student Succeeds Act&lt;/I&gt; provides a solid foundation for scholars, advocates, and policy makers as they begin to navigate a new era in education policy.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

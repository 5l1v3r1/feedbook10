  <title>Two-Over-One Game Force System - Niel H. Timm, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Two-Over One Game Force bidding system is an improvement over the Standard American System that has been in effect and played by bridge players for many years. The advantage of the 2/1 system is that it allows the partnership to know that game is possible with only a single bid. In this book, I have tried to present the fundamental aspects of the bidding structure for playing a pure two-over-one game force system of bidding.
While many players claim they play 2/1, this is not the case. They have allowed the bidding structure of Standard American to prevail, like bidding suits up the line or ignoring the Walsh club.
In this book, I have tried to change behavior by presenting a series of bids geared toward the 2/1 bidding structure where simply stated means that any auction that starts with an opening one-bid that is followed with a response at the two level of a lower-ranking suit represents a game forcing bidding sequence. Also included in the book are Bergen, Reverse Bergen, and Combined Bergen raises, inverted minor suit raises with crisscross and flip-flop, cue bidding, modified scroll bids, and many more methods In the third edition, the chapter on Slam bidding has been expanded to include asking for aces and kings simultaneously, the Baron 4NT convention, and more. New material on Roman Jump overcalls, the Mc Cabe Adjunct and the Reverse Mc Cabe Adjunct, Bergens Jacoby 2NT bids, Meckwell major suit bids and Meckwell responses to minor suit openings, more on interference over strong notrump, minor suit Stayman, Kokish Relays and several other conventions have been added to this latest edition. Several new bidding systems have been added to this final fifth edition; they include Tartan Weak Two Bids, The Walsh Club Convention, the Principle of Restricted Choice, additional methods for interfering over the strong precision club bid, Variable Roman Keycard Blackwood, Spiral Scan bids, the Swedish 2NT bid, and more on interference over strong notrump bids.
Also included is an update of the Minorwood and the Roman Keycard Blackwood Conventions, Two-Way New Minor Forcing with modified Wolff Signoff bids and new bidding sequences using Mini/Weak Notrump. The topic of Offense to Defense Ratio (ODR) is included in this revision as well as expanded bidding sequences when opening and responding to the bid of two playing the 2/1 Game Force System and several new Bridge Rules have been added to chapter 10. You may find Timms Bridge Bits, several duplicate bridge lessons, and a free pdf copy of this book on the website www.bridgewebs.com/ocala." />

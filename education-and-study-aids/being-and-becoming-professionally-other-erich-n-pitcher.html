  <title>Being and Becoming Professionally Other - Erich N. Pitcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Being and Becoming Professionally Other: Identities, Voices, and Experiences of U.S. Trans* Academics&lt;/EM&gt; is a path-clearing book that provides a rich, in-depth account of the lived experiences of 39 transgender or trans* academics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Despite increased visibility of trans* issues within higher education, college environments remain unfriendly, and in some cases, overtly hostile to trans* people. While there is much discussion of gender equity and faculty diversity, these conversations rarely include trans* academics’ voices. As a study participant described, trans* voices are often out of place at best—or worse, completely discounted in academe, a betwixt place. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By not fitting into a particular mold, trans* academics experience a variety of adverse events including microaggressions, outright hostility, and exclusion. These adverse experiences create a context wherein trans* academics engage in various forms of additional labor. While not necessarily unique to trans* academics, these various forms of labor provided evidence to support my assertion that trans* academics are or become professionally Other.  Given this Other status, trans* academics must form broad coalitions to bring about change within higher education organizations. Additionally, higher education leaders have an opportunity to change organizational contexts to better support trans* academics by radically re-imagining colleges and universities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This text would be an excellent choice for graduate and undergraduate courses about gender, qualitative research methods courses, and courses about academic careers, and organizational theories. &lt;/P&gt;" />

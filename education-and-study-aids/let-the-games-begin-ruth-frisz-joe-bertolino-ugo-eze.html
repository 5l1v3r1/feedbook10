  <title>Let the Games Begin - Ruth Frisz, Joe Bertolino, Ugo Eze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Have you ever led a group or taught, facilitated a workshop or taught a class and needed the perfect, interactive ice breaker or thought provoking exercise? This manuel provides just that! As facilitators, speakers and professors, we found we were always looking for interactive exercises that allow students and participants to reflect, think and learn. As a result, this first collection of exercises from the Queens College Student Personnel Departments Peer and Leadership Program was created. The majority of these exercises have been created by students, for students.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These activities can be used by many different types of organizations including, but not limited to educational institutions, businesses, non-profit organizations, and religious institutions. The activities lend themselves to adjustments and revisions depending on the goals of the workshop, conference, retreat or in-service meetings. This manual is designed to offer ideas and suggestions to those who want to provide this kind of opportunity to their employees, students, administrators, management teams or others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fun, interactive and thought provoking, these exercises are the perfect solution to creating a dynamic learning environment.&lt;/P&gt;

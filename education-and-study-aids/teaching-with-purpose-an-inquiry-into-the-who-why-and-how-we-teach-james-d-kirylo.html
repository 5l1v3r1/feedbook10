  <title>Teaching with Purpose: An Inquiry into the Who, Why, And How We Teach - James D. Kirylo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For five days a week for approximately nine months out of the year totaling countless hours, teachers work with other people&amp;rsquo;s most treasured gifts&amp;mdash;their children. That the teacher is the most important element in fostering an energetic, engaging, and inspiring classroom environment where authentic learning can unfold cannot be overstated. Indeed, it is the teacher who understands self or does not; it is the teacher who is prepared or is not; it is the teacher who has command of subject matter or does not; it is the teacher who inculcates in an appropriate way or does not; and, it is the teacher who is patient, understanding, empathetic, and enthusiastic or is not. To that end, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Teaching With Purpose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; underscores what it means to be an insightful teacher, foundationally emphasizing that the central aspect toward richly transforming education is through the professionalization of what it means to be a teacher. Written in accessible language, and attentive to connecting theory to practice, the benefits and features of this book are mindful of a diverse readership. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

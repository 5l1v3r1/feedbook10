  <title>High School Students Tackle Citizenship Test - Jean Sebelist Hayworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a high school teacher of government and AP Us history, I found it compelling to prepare my students to be an educated electorate. In many cases, students did not go on to college, and this was the last opportunity I had as a teacher to inform them about the workings of the federal and state government.
As a high school teacher of government and AP Us history, I found it compelling to prepare my students to be an educated electorate. In many cases, students did not go on to college, and this was the last opportunity I had as a teacher to inform them about the workings of the federal and state government.
Several students were instrumental in creating an atmosphere of challenge and the desire to be more knowledgeable.
As a result, I formulated a pretest that became the citizenship Test for my high school students in government. Since it is required in most high schools across the nation, other teachers might find this a good guidebook.
That citizenship test and the student responses are the basis for this book, which I hope the readers will find enlightening and educational.
This is my attempt to educate the electorate about basic information that every citizen should know about their government and maybe encourage them to want to know more." />

  <title>Catching a Story by the Tale - Tom Gatten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Kojo Hand A NOVEL BY TOM GATTEN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Im very impressed with the vivid characterization here. From the self-conscious, guarded, headstrong Deanie, the hilariously crass but needy Barett, to the big-hearted Zerk, tortured by his past, and the quietly noble Kojo, each character is unique, consistent, and nicely layered. Deanies struggle to discover and stand by beliefs in an adult world that is constantly asking her to compromise is especially engaging. I also admire the moral force underlying the narrative: The Kojo Hand makes it clear that longingwhether for recognition, sex, fame, a sense of belongingcan lead to destruction and isolation when people let their desires blindly motivate them. The Kojo Hand is a giving and humane novel, exploring interesting and important human problems with a gentle hand.&lt;br&gt;
 Writers Digest&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapper of Mists POEMS AND TRANSLATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I think Tom Gattens Mapper of Mists is a remarkable book of poems. For years Ive been familiar with Gattens work and here we have it together with a great deal of grace, intensity and energy. &lt;br&gt;
 Jim Harrison&lt;br&gt;
Author of Letters to Yesenin, Legends of the Fall, Dalva, The Woman Lit by Fireflies, Returning to Earth, The River Swimmer &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bamboushay Steel Band  RECORDING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Gatten played with The Bamboushay Steel Band for two years.  Based in East Lansing, the band played in places ranging from the original Hamtramck High School to the famous Gate of Horn club in Chicago.  In 1962, National Educational Television produced, broadcast, and rebroadcast a half-hour show by the band. The bands Folkways Records LP Album #FS3835 was reissued on Compact Disc by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in 2001 and is also available on iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;" />

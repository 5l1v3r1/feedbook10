  <title>Deconstructing Sammy - Matt Birkbeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sammy Davis Jr. lived a storied life. Adored by millions over a six-decade-long career, he was considered an entertainment icon and a national treasure. But despite lifetime earnings that topped $50 million, Sammy died in 1990 near bankruptcy. His estate was declared insolvent, and there was no possibility of itever using Sammy&#39;s name or likeness again. It was as if Sammy had never existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later his wife, Altovise, a once-vivacious woman and heir to one of the greatest entertainment legacies of the twentieth century, was living in poverty, and with nowhere else to go, she turned to a former federal prosecutor, Albert &quot;Sonny&quot; Murray, to make one last attempt to resolve Sammy&#39;s debts, restore his estate, and revive his legacy. For seven years Sonny probed Sammy&#39;s life to understand how someone of great notoriety and wealth could have lost everything, and in the process he came to understand Sammy as a man whose complexity makes for a riveting work of celebrity biography as cultural history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Birkbeck&#39;s serious work of investigative journalism unveils the extraordinary story of an international celebrity at the center of a confluence of entertainment, politics, and organized crime, and shows how even Sammy&#39;s outsized talent couldn&#39;t save him from himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>An Anointed Man Who Care About People - Elder John R. Walden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is John Walden. I am married to a great woman of integrity who has brought nothing but joy into my life since the day we said our vows before God. She has been there through the good, the bad, and the ugly. Together we adopted three children and have been foster parents to several others. Children have always been a part of our lives for as long as I can remember. We currently reside in Stapleton, GA where our children attend school in Wrens, GA. We attend Praise Deliverance Campus and Ministries International of Wrens as a family. The ministry is under the leadership of Dr. Christine A. Wallace of Augusta, GA. I serve as an Elder in the ministry and often wears the hat of many workmen. I have taken some classes online and not all were good experiences. I am determined to succeed and vow to myself to give 112 percent to accomplish the goals that I have set for myself. I decided to return to school so that I could set an example for my children. I dont want to encourage them to do something that I have not attempted to do myself. I feel that it is important to lead by example. My interest is working in the community to encourage young men to seek God. To let them know there is something better in this world we live in then what we are faced with from day to day if we put God first. I hope to expand my territory and broaden my outreach ministry to include the surrounding areas of Wrens, GA and beyond. I have an interest in developing a group home and safe house for trouble teens. My heart goes out to any man, woman, boy, or girl who feel they have no where to go and no one to turn to. I want to provide a safe haven for those in need. So many children have came through our home too." />

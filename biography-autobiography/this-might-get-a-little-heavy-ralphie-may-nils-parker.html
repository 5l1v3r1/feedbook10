  <title>This Might Get a Little Heavy - Ralphie May, Nils Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Ralphie May was one of the biggest standup comedians in the country, both by ticket sales and by tonnage. While some things changed--Ralphie lost half his body weight--others did not: he will be remembered as one of the most successful comics of his time. Completed just months before his untimely passing, in &lt;i&gt;This Might Get a Little Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Ralphie takes readers on a behind-the-scenes tour of his life and career, one that winds across the country, over obstacles, beyond heartbreak, and through the golden age of stand-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised in poor, rural, Arkansas by a single mom who struggled to make ends meet, Ralphie&#39;s early years were the perfect breeding ground for the kind of pain and stress and adversity that only comedy can cure. Bitten by the comedy bug at a Methodist sleep-away camp when he was 12 years old, Ralphie seized a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity six years later at an open-mic in a pizza parlor. Mentored and inspired by legendary comedian Sam Kinison to move to Houston, where he got his start, Ralphie packed his bags and never looked back. A major headliner for over twenty-five years, in &lt;i&gt;This Might Get A Little Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Ralphie finally tells the world how a chubby poor kid from Clarksville went from Arkansas to Houston to Hollywood and beyond. Full of never before told stories from Ralphie&#39;s life, &lt;i&gt;This Might Get A Little Heavy&lt;/i&gt; will bust your gut, pull at your heart strings, and touch your soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />

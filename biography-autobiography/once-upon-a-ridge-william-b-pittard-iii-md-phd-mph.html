  <title>Once Upon a Ridge - William B. Pittard Iii Md PhD Mph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Supin Lick Mountain in Rockingham County, Virginia, offers residents majestic views that make it easy to contemplate life, enjoy solitude, and gain wisdom.
Its a place that the Pittard family has enjoyed for three generations, and during that time, theyve built the cabin of their dreams while mingling with local residents. 
In this family memoir, William B. Pittard III highlights the mountains stellar beauty, amazing wildlife, and the lifestyle of mountain residents who embrace hard manual labor while assisting those in need. While some might think these mountain folk are a bit clannish, they treat neighbors the same way theyd want to be treated.
Life on the mountain has changed in the last century with electricity, telephones, and reliable modes of transportation, but the setting itself with its dirt/gravel roadways canopied by expansive trees has not. The genuine willingness, even expectation, to take responsibility for ones own actions also remains unchanged. 
Join the Pittard family as they become one with the mountain, enjoying sunrises in the mornings, plantings in the spring, bright leaves against sunny blue skies, and so much more in Once Upon a Ridge." />

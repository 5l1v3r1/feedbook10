  <title>Thin Is the New Happy - Valerie Frankel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Valerie Frankel, author of the hilarious memoir IT&#39;S HARD NOT TO HATE YOU, comes a hilarious, unflinching, self-deprecating, and joy-filled memoir that will appeal to every women, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;the mirror is not your friend.&quot; For Valerie Frankel, the mirror was so much more than &quot;not a friend.&quot; It was the mean girl who stole her lunch money, bitch-slapped her in the ladies&#39; room, and cut the hair off her Barbie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most women, Valerie spent most of her conscious life on a diet, thinking about a diet, ignoring a diet, or failing on a diet. At age eleven, her mother put Val on her first weight-loss program. As a teen, she was enrolled in Weight Watchers (for which she invented creative ditching methods). As a young woman, her world felt right only when she was able to zip a certain pair of jeans. Not wanting to pass this legacy on to her own daughters, Valerie set out to cleanse herself of her obsession. Thin Is the New Happy is the true story of one woman&#39;s quest to exorcise her bad body-image demons, to uncover the truths behind what put them there, and to learn how to truly love herself. &lt;br&gt;This ebook edition includes two bonus essays from the new memoir &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Hard Not to Hate You. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

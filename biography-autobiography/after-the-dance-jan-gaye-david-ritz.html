  <title>After the Dance - Jan Gaye, David Ritz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A riveting cautionary tale about the ecstasy and dangers of loving Marvin Gaye, a performer passionately pursued by all&amp;#8212;and a searing memoir of drugs, sex, and old school R&amp;#38;B from the wife of legendary soul icon Marvin Gaye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her seventeenth birthday in 1973, Janis Hunter met Marvin Gaye&amp;#8212;the soulful prince of Motown with the seductive liquid voice whose chart-topping, socially conscious album &lt;em&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Going On&lt;/em&gt; made him a superstar two years earlier. Despite a seventeen-year-age difference and Marvin&amp;#8217;s marriage to the sister of Berry Gordy, Motown&amp;#8217;s founder, the enchanted teenager and the emotionally volatile singer began a scorching relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One moment Jan was a high school student; the next she was accompanying Marvin to parties, navigating the intriguing world of 1970s-&amp;#8216;80s celebrity; hanging with Don Cornelius on the set of &lt;em&gt;Soul Train&lt;/em&gt;, and helping to discover new talent like Frankie Beverly. But the burdens of fame, the chaos of dysfunctional families, and the irresistible temptations of drugs complicated their love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily silent since Marvin&amp;#8217;s tragic death in 1984, Jan at last opens up, sharing the moving, fervently charged story of one of music history&amp;#8217;s most fabled marriages. Unsparing in its honesty and insight, illustrated with sixteen pages of black-and-white photos, &lt;em&gt;After the Dance&lt;/em&gt; reveals what it&amp;#8217;s like to be in love with a creative genius who&amp;#160;transformed popular culture and whose artistry continues to be celebrated today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

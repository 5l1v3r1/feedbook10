  <title>The Girl Who Lived - Susan Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Who Lived is the true story of Susan Berg, the sole survivor of a boating accident that claimed the lives of her parents and brother, and what it took for her to love life again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At fifteen, Susan was on a boat trip with her parents and brother when their vessel began to sink. Desperate to find help, she swam ahead, struggling through darkness and rough sea. After nearly four hours, Susan, exhausted and barely able to walk, finally made it ashore. Her family did not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wracked by survivor guilt, Susan began to rebel against the world. Looking for solace in sex and party drugs, she charged down a path of self-destruction. Though barely able to look after herself, she became a mother at twenty and had to navigate for two. It was not until many years later, when Susan cheated death for a second time, that she learned to love herself, and life, again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a candid, dramatic and powerful memoir for anyone who has ever lost their way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

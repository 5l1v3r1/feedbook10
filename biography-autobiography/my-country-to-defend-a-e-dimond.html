  <title>My Country to Defend - A. E. Dimond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m living my life one day at a time. Sitting here picturing home with a small tear in my eyes. Spending time with my brothers who will hold my life in their hands &lt;/p&gt;
-PFC Diego Rincon, February 22, 2003, Kuwait&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
His final letter home to his mother made international news. His death in the line of duty inspired U.S. law. In the passionate defense of his adopted homeland, Private First Class Diego Rincon lost his life to the first-known suicide attack on U.S. soldiers in Operation Iraqi Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
A.E. Dimond delivers the gripping account of an American hero in a tip of the spear fight to Baghdad with the Outlaw Platoon-a conviction that compels his proud immigrant family to assume not only the blessings but the extreme burdens of freedom. More than a timeless war story, this true account of devotion to the American dream pays tribute to liberty&#39;s brave defenders, and those they leave behind in the continued War on Terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;It&#39;s my country to defend, Papi &quot; &lt;br&gt;
They were wrenching words in the wake of the September 11 attacks, and momentous in the wake of the war.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Vayase.&quot; Go then, Jorge said quietly. America was Diego&#39;s soul mate &quot;Join the Army,&quot; Diego&#39;s father gave his blessing again, and his mother turned her head.&lt;br&gt;
There was a haunting, piercing pain in her breast, taking her breath away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

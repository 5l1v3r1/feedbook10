  <title>A Daughter&#39;s Journey - Heather Jaynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a father and daughter driving a jeep, packed to the top with household items, and towing a large storage box, laden with heavy household and garage machines, from London to Bulgaria by crossing three countries.
The daughter did the driving. It was tough, on a time limit, and by no means trouble-free.
Just when I thought my hard work was over, and I was about to go home, my nightmare was about to start.
Heather is an experienced distance driver, often travelling from Ireland to Wales or, driving for many miles in Spain, but not anything quite as distant as what she was about to take on.
Heather considered herself fairly fit because she was a dressage rider and trained at least four times a week on her lovely horse, Ebony Lady.
Heather had not seen her dad in two years, although they spoke on the phone nearly every day, so this journey was a holiday to her as well as an adventure driving through Europe with her dad." />

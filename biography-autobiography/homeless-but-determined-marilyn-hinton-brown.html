  <title>Homeless but Determined - Marilyn Hinton-Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stride like a Cheetah and Pursue! 
This book is about a woman who has overcome the trials and tribulations of life. She has exemplified the character as a survivor and an overcomer. She started out as an ordinary woman who enrolled in an institution of higher learning majoring in politics and criminal justice, assisting elected officials in various campaigns, pursuing a government career, government internships and raising two children. Somehow, an interruption of life had occurred and this was the beginning of a change of life. 
During her homeless journey, she was involved in a bitter custody battle of her two children, the loss of her mother and her government job- simultaneously. Yet she dreamed about her ambitions and goals to bring it into fruition. It was relative to a woman in travail giving birth to an impossible dream. 
In this book, failing forward is very successful. It may not be evident at the time, however, she offers the remedy to accomplish and achieve whatever you have set your mind to do. 
Trials + Pursuing = Success 
Take your trials and use them to your advantage to help someone else. 
Pursue!

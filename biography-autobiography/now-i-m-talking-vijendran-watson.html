  <title>Now I’M Talking - Vijendran Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vijendran Watson shares the lessons he learned as one of South Asias leading mobile communcations pioneers in this candid memoir.
His journey starts in the United Kingdom and takes him to Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and Asia, allowing him to lead seven different companies in five different countries. He influenced the development and delivery of mobile communications that millions of people relied on.
With the advent of mobile technology, a fisherman off the coast of Chilaw in Sri Lanka can communicate the details of his catch so salespeople may start selling before he reaches shore; a rikshawala driver in Bangladesh can arrange the pickup of his next passenger from miles away; and a construction worker in Mumbai can send cash to his family in remote Bihar, one of the poorest places in India, with the push of a button.
Mobile communications transformed the lives of ordinary people, but it wouldnt have happened if ordinary men and women hadnt set out on a mission believing failure was impossible. Thats just one of many business and life lessons youll learn in Now Im Talking." />

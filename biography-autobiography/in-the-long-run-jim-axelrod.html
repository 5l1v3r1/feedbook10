  <title>In the Long Run - Jim Axelrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 2008. Jim Axelrod--once among the most watched correspondents on network news and the first television reporter to broadcast from Saddam International Airport in 2003--is covering the final stages of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. He&#39;s forty-five years old and thirty pounds overweight. He&#39;s drinking too much, sleeping too little, and scarcely seeing his family. He&#39;s just figured out that the industry that pulled him up the corporate ladder is imploding as he&#39;s reaching for its final rungs. Then, out of the blue, Jim discovers his late father&#39;s decades-old New York Marathon finish times. At forty-six, Bob Axelrod ran a 3:29:58. With everything else going on in his life, Jim sets himself a defining challenge: &quot;Can I beat him?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins a deeply felt, often hilarious, quixotic effort to run the 2009 New York Marathon. Along the way, Jim confronts his listing marriage, a career upset by the seismic changes going on throughout the television news industry, excruciatingly painful shin splints, and the worst-timed kidney stone possible. Looming over it all is the shadow of a loving father, who repeatedly lost his way in life but still has a lesson to impart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a book about a dead father&#39;s challenge to a son at a crossroads, but, more than that, it is about the personal costs paid when ambition and talent are not enough to ensure success. Most fundamentally, though, it is a book about learning what it takes to be happy in your own skin.&lt;/p&gt;" />

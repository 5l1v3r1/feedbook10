  <title>WHAT WE DID FOR LOVE - Mary Ann O&#39;Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the tale of a young girl from Brooklyn who dared to live her dreams. Overcoming her fears and insecurities, she persevered. Her determination, strong faith and &lt;u&gt;demanding work&lt;/u&gt; propelled her toward manifesting those dreams. A child of the 50s, teen of the 60s and a wife and working mother of the 70s, Mary Ann was a product of her time. She juggled her career and raised her small children while she and her husband Andy Beu participated in Broadway&amp;#39;s biggest musical theatre sensation, A CHORUS LINE. In this memoir, Mary Ann takes us on a journey through the ups and downs of her early career&amp;hellip; in show business -- sharing the process and glamour of being part of the iconic theatrical experience. Exposing her insecurities with honesty and humor she ushers the reader behind the scenes, through the nerve wracking auditions, the multi-company rehearsals at City Center and the excitement of opening nights and star-studded Hollywood parties. The drama builds as her health and integrity are challenged. Standing her ground as the pressure mounts, she and her husband Andy make a decision no one foresees.&lt;/p&gt;" />

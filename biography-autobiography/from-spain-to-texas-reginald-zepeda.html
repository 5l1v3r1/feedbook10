  <title>From Spain to Texas - Reginald Zepeda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book about the Cepeda Family was written not to document history or historical events, but to place a timeline history and genealogy around the name Cepeda. Author Reginald Zepedas purpose for this book is to unlock the secrets of his familys past and to share with others, whether related directly or indirectly, the history and genealogy of the Zepedas in Texas.
In seeking the truth of his heritage, he delves into the distant past, beginning with ancient Spain and the origins of the Basque people, and then moving forward to the Spanish conquest of the New World. As reward for spreading God, and bringing back Gold and Glory to the Crown, the conquistadores were given a share of these annexed lands. Among them were the Cepedas, who would find their fortunes in the Americas, in Mexico and, ultimately, in Texas.
Reginald chronicles the journey of his ancestors From Spain to Texas, and how their line spread and how their lives intersected with the course of history. Conquests, miracles, hardships and fortunes, all were experienced by their distinguished line through the ages, as the fruits of their undertakings were passed down from generation to generation. Now, after painstaking research, Reginald presents a compendium that proudly displays his familys exploits, lineage, and identity, for the inheritors of a legacy spanning centuries  the next generation of Cepedas." />

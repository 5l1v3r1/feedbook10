      <meta name="description" content="This story takes place mainly in the houses where Earl Hancock lived in Hawthorne Park and Fullerton, when Earl lived with his wife, Marie, and his son and while he worked at NASA, then went to the moon in the 1970s.
This is the drama between the forces of good and evil trying to raise a child during the space age, to have a little boy grow up healthy and happy. It will show the struggle between common sense and cruelty and how Earl Hancock was a real feeling and thinking human being who dearly cared for his son and his family, and in spite of his self-medicating with alcohol, he did everything in his power to have a happy family. With his wife, Marie, trying to destroy him, Earl realized that he was going to have to fight to make his dreams, and that of his son, come true. His son would realize all too soon that he would have to fight for a long time also." />

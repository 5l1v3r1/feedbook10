  <title>Climbing a Florida Mountain - John Freshwater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Climbing A Florida Mountain&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is the memoir of an English family who moved to Florida in 1981 in search of the American dream. John Freshwater, his wife Mo and their three young children gave up a privileged lifestyle in southern England to try their luck in Naples, Florida. But the quest has been something of a nightmare, with amazing tales of financial disaster, cultural clashes and immigration hell. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Despite the Freshwater&#39;s troubles, it is a moving and highly amusing account, which is written, in a fast, first person style by the father of the family. The story has an uplifting and poignancy ending that goes some way to proving the pursuit of material pleasures is not necessarily the answer. This is more than a simple &#39;relocation&#39; yarn and reflects the realities of a decent family trying to get on in this world.

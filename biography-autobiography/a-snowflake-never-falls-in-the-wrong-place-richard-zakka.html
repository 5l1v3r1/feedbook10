  <title>A Snowflake Never Falls in the Wrong Place - Richard Zakka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Zakkas story began in Aden, a British colony, during the 1950s. At an early age, it occurred to him how every detail in life is so perfect. No accidents, even in what appeared to be an accident. As each snowflake is original in character and majestic in beauty, tiny in size, it will always fall in its perfect place on earth according to Gods perfect plan, a perfect 13. He realized that all of lifes events are but steps to condition his evolution to perfecting his relationship with his Maker.
When he was thirteen, his family moved to the US and began a new chapter. After studying civil engineering in Texas, Richard decided to move to New York and enroll at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and became an actor.
After graduation, he was fortunate to land several roles in films and commercials. At the same time, to fulfill a promise to his father who was skeptical about an acting career, he started several businesses in the Big City.
A whirlwind of marriage, family, filmmaking, and successful businesses were like snowflakes landing one after another, guiding his life path. Richard weaves a fascinating story that traces the arc of a creative entrepreneurs career from one exciting endeavor to the next." />

  <title>A Little Something Beautiful - Brenda Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a dream but needed the courage to take that first step? Discover how God worked through one womans talents to turn her dreams into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Life has often been a series of hurdles and obstacles for Brenda Scott that could only be overcome with her unwavering faith and constant determination for continuous improvement. This self-taught artist found her way through many art mediums with no formal training but was instead empowered by many strong, creative women along the way. Learn lessons of humility, gratitude, patience, and forgiveness as she takes us on a journey of her lifetime path of art and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Discover how her goal to become a successful artist led to the biggest project of her life: renovating her old country Victorian home. It became a major undertaking that would test both her spirit and her resolve to see the process through to the very end. Savoring country life while taking on the challenges of that renovation taught her the beauty to be found in the ordinary, everyday life all around her on the acreage. Through this endeavor she began to realize that she was on a course that would determine who she was as an artist and that the real restoration project was within herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Family Cars Trigger Memoirs - Dr. H. Kenneth Shook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In 1963, Dr. H. Kenneth Shook attended an auction just four doors down from his apartment in Westminster, Maryland, to buy a typewriterand instead returned as the homes new owner. As a photograph is snapped of his wife and son sitting on the tailgate of the station wagon that would be used to transport their belongings just a short way down the street, Shook has no idea that one day, that simple photograph will trigger him to write compilation of memories.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In his second volume of memoirs, Shook shares true accounts of his life inspired by his many memories of family cars. Beginning with his first recollections at age four, Shook provides a glimpse back into a time when mothers stayed home with their children, televisions did not have a place in the home, and fathers parked the family car on Main Street on a Saturday night to watch the world go by. As he details his coming-of-age journey through childhood, college, military service, and adulthood, Shook chronicles not only his life experiences, but also the purchases of vehicles that accompanied him on his journey through life that included retired police cars, a Dodge Dart, and a beloved station wagon.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Family Cars Trigger Memoirs offers entertaining anecdotes that illustrate the important role that family cars take in one mans journey through life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The final portions of this book include memoirs triggered by distant travels and memoirs triggered by other peoples memoirs. The author also allows two memoirs from his first book to return for an encore performance.&lt;/P&gt;" />

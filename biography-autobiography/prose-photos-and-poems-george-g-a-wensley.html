  <title>Prose, Photos and Poems - George G A Wensley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prose, Photos and Poems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a compendium of short stories, poems and memoirs, of a writer learning his craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is peppered with photographs as he is interested in the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry is important to his work as it makes you think and wring out everything you possibly can from a word, and to be able to manipulate the elements of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madam Clich is about the writers love of the sound of the word Clich and his regret at its meaning and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places and travel are important to the writer. Places become characters in his writing. Dreamlands is about a visit he made to Margate and the Turner Gallery, it is modelled on The Waste Land by TS Elliot and was one of the pieces that got the writer a Certificate in Creative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice in the Rain is about a trip the writer made to Venice while researching for his Rialto Trilogy. He wrote stuff down as he walked through the landscape and it is just as much about memory as it is about the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photography was done on his camera that was inherited from his father who was a member of the Royal Photographic Society and has been to symposiums at Fox Talbots House and has replicated the smoking mirrors experiment. The writer believes that photography is about the pictures you dont make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer likes to call this sort of work Moodalogues.&lt;/p&gt;" />

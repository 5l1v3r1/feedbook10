  <title>East German Girl - Jacqualynn Bogie, Sigrid Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;War memories do not have an age requirement. They force you to mature and give you no choice but to cope with the realities of the world. In this memoir, author Sigrid Jackson tells what it was like being a child of war in East Germany before and after World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;East German Girl,&lt;/i&gt; Jackson describes what it was like to live through the bombing raids, food shortages, diphtheria, communism, and being forced to leave her home with her mother and brother to be relocated to a rural farm. Using personal anecdotes to illustrate how God has worked in her life, Jackson demonstrates the courage that was necessary to escape East Germany to freedom in the west when she was just twelve years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an alcoholic, absentee father to an unsuspecting future husband, life continuously threw her curveballs, but &lt;i&gt;East German Girl&lt;/i&gt; narrates an inspirational story of war, communism, family betrayal, and finally resilience.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Cancer Conundrum - Rick Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When Rick Hill, who was diagnosed at the MAyo Clinic with very aggressive embryonal cell carcinoma at a very young age, learned about a nutritional clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, that was treating terminally ill people, he journeyd south.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hill, a former stand-up comic readio talk-show host, takes you on a hilarious and poignant trip through helath food stores in the 1970s and his experiences at the Mayo Clinic. He recalls how he went from a &quot;greaser&quot; to a tree-hugger and food fanatic, but nothing compares with how he slipped through a rabbit hole, ended up in Mexico, and beat &lt;i&gt;The Cancer Conundrum&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Cancer Conundrum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t let the title of this book fool you, this is laugh-out-loud funny. It also has a life-giving message.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Dr. Brent Allan, Scottsdale, AZ.
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Like my father before me, I have admired Rick&#39;s willingness to stay on his program and share with others his success.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
Dr. Francisco Contreras, &lt;i&gt;Oasis of Hope&lt;/i&gt;, Tijuana, Baja BC

&lt;P&gt;Rick&#39;s style of humor and dedication to &#39;Resetting&quot; his life daily us an inspiration!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;

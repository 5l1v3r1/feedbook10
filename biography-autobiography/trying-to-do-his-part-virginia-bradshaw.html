  <title>Trying to Do His Part - Virginia Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alone on a cold Italian mountaintop in World War II, CECIL E. JOHNSTON, a wet, hungry GI with no idea what was coming next, made a covenant with God. His prayer was answered and Johnston began trying to do his part.&lt;p&gt;
What followed was meritorious military service,
lengthy public service, a wide spectrum of community service and an outstanding
professional record.&lt;p
Now 89, the retired U.S. Army major delivers a Meals on Wheels route to the old folks, as he
terms it, participates in his civic club, a committee erecting a state war veterans memorial in his central Oklahoma hometown,
other civic and patriotic activities and chairs his churchs administrative board.&lt;p&gt;
Johnston is still trying to do his part of the long-ago covenant. This, his life story, describes that effort and how hes used hard work, determination, ingenuity and courage to be successful in many areas from his teens to today-2010." />

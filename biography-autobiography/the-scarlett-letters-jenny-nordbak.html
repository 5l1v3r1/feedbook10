  <title>The Scarlett Letters - Jenny Nordbak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jenny Nordbak takes us to a place that few have seen, but millions have fantasized about, revealing how she transformed herself from a USC grad lacking in confidence into an elite professional dominatrix who finds her own voice, power and compassion for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an unorthodox quest to understand her hidden fantasies, Jenny led a double life for two years. By day she was a construction manager, but at night she became Mistress Scarlett. Working at LA&#39;s longest-running dungeon, she catered to the secret fetishes of clients ranging from accountants to movie stars. She simultaneously developed a career in the complex and male-dominated world of healthcare construction, while spending her nights as a sex worker, dominating men. Far from the standard-issue powerful men who pay to be helpless, Mistress Scarlett&#39;s clientele included men whose fantasies revealed more complex needs, from &quot;Tickle Ed&quot; to &quot;Doggie Dan,&quot; from the &quot;Treasure Trolls&quot; to &quot;Ta-Da Ted.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Scarlett Letters &lt;/i&gt;explores the spectacularly diverse array of human sexuality and the fascinating cast of characters that the author encountered along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />

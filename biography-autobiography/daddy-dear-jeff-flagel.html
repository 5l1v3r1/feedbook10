  <title>Daddy Dear - Jeff Flagel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I have never taken anything more seriously than parenting, say nothing of doing it alone -- in a virtual vacuum -- every day bringing a new challenge, problem and occasionally a fantastic event involving one of my boys that I&#39;ll remember as long as I live. Eric asked me once some time ago if I would do it all again -- marry his mother again -- go it alone with two helpless children to care for. Even to this day -- as I look at him, and although his brother, Travis, has been a challenge, to say the least, when I think of all our triumphs -- I couldn&#39;t imagine living life without them. So I guess I didn&#39;t really answer the question, did I? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The events in this book are true, and they have been written in the hopes that my boys can learn more about their Dad later, when they dont want, or need anything from me, except of course, my love and friendship.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I was married and divorced inside of two years, and only six weeks later woke up to the responsibility of raising a 3  year old and 11 month old all by myself. I hadnt even adopted Travis yet, as his mother would play head games with us both  I suppose punishing me for not being his natural father so go figure. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book documents, in almost a timeline by-chapter, significant events and the emotional consequences that accompanied most all of them. It follows my career and desperation for monetary support early-on, as well as the boys lives from diapers through young adulthood, including childhood, adolescence, and the incredible task of letting go as they assert their independence. It is a journey of love  one that I hope my children will understand at some point, when and if they take the time to sit and read this story of single fatherhood  and of their own young lives.&lt;/P&gt;" />

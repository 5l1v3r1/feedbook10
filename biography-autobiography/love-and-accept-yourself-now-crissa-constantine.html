  <title>Love and Accept Yourself Now - Crissa Constantine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of us do not love or accept ourselves completely, and too many of us live with a harsh inner critic that can do more damage to our self-esteem than our worst enemies ever could. Worldwide studies show that a lack of self-esteem leads to most mental health problems and that huge numbers of people are suffering needlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While undergoing chemotherapy for invasive ovarian cancera disease few women surviveauthor Crissa Constantine received valuable counseling that changed her life forever. She shed her negative baggage, disarmed her inner critic, and learned to love and accept herself 100 percent. This total transformation felt so wonderful that she decided to share it with everyone. In this memoir, she tells the story of her journey through cancer and also shares stories aimed at describing her change in perspective and helping others to gain that same confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All schools of thought, social research, and major religions point to the same conclusion: you have a right to totally accept yourself, and you shouldnt have to face a life-threatening disease to see the light.&lt;/p&gt;" />

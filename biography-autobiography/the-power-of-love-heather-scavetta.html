  <title>The Power of Love - Heather Scavetta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Theres an old folk tale about a young mother who lost her child and is inconsolable. The wise man of the village tells her to go from house to house to
    find what everyone sharesand what everyone sharesis loss. Its the universal experience.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Although we all will grieve the loss of our loved ones, we can learn how to reconnect with them. Through prayer and meditation, we can shift our awareness
    from the physical to the non-physical. We can witness firsthand that death is but an illusion. We can heal. We can find joy again. Author Heather Scavetta
    discovered that reality when she began developing her clairvoyant abilities after the death of her daughter, Elizabeth, in 2004.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    In The Power of Love, Scavetta shares her personal journey of receiving visions and afterlife communication from her daughter, loved ones, and spirit
    guides who encourage her to persevere through her grief. Having no previous ability, Scavetta shows that opening up spiritual gifts is accessible to
    everyone. Through personal examples, she shares how to open your own psychic and mediumistic abilities, and she discusses the many ways spirit can reach
    us.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    A story of celebration about the amazing and wonderful experiences that occurred since Elizabeths transition, The Power of Love narrates one familys
    story of how they opened their spiritual gifts to see, hear, and feeland to know beyond any doubttheir daughter never left their side.

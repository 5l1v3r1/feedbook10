  <title>&quot;Home Is Where the Harp Is&quot; - Patricia Ann Harris Packer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From humble beginnings, as a child of the Great Depression and World War II, Pat Packer has lived through the good times and the bad, as have many others. She was married at a young age, raised five children, and managed to live through the unexpected loss of one of those children to a tragedy. She was a successful business owner, building two authentic Irish pubs from scratch: McCarthys Party in Detroit, Michigan, and The Harp and Thistle in St. Pete Beach, Florida. Through tears and laughter, ups and downs, and her unwavering faith in God, she is telling her story from her home in St. Pete Beach, Florida.
Just for today, I will adjust myself to what is and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my luck as it comes and fit myself to it.

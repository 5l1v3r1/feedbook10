      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before he was one of the most well-known yoga teachers in North America and an international hip hop artist,&amp;#160;MC YOGI was a juvenile delinquent who was kicked out of three schools, sent to live at a group home for at-risk youth, arrested for vandalism,&amp;#160;and caught up in a world of drugs,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;chaos and carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At eighteen, fate brought him to his first yoga class.

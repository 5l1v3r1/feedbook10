  <title>On the Wild Edge - David Petersen, John Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Opinionated and iconoclastic, Petersen writes with humor and a well-honed craft that will delight fans of Edward Abbey.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Twenty-five years ago David Petersen and his wife, Caroline, pulled up stakes, trading Laguna Beach, California, for a snug hand-built cabin in the wilderness.    Today he knows that mountain land as intimately as anyone can know his home. &lt;br&gt;    Petersen conflates a quarter century into the adventures of four high-country seasons, tracking the rigors of survival from the snowmelt that announces the arrival of spring to the decline and death of autumn and winter that will establish the fertile ground needed for next year&#39;s rebirth. &lt;br&gt;    In the past we listened to Henry David Thoreau or Aldo Leopold; today it is Petersen&#39;s turn. His observations are lyrical, scientific, and from the heart. He reinforces Thoreau&#39;s dictum: &quot;in wildness is the preservation of the earth.&quot; In prose rich with mystery and soul, his words are a plea for the survival of the remnant wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many of us would like to live a life of greater intention and simplicity, but few can and even fewer do. David Petersen is one of those rare human beings among us who lives a wild life with a cultured mind . . . [He] has created a map all of us can follow.&quot;-Terry Tempest Williams, author of &lt;i&gt;The Open Space of Democracy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

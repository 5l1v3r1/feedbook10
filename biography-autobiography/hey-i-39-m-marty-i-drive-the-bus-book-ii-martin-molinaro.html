  <title>Hey, I&#39;m Marty. I Drive the Bus! Book Ii - Martin Molinaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marty is a Professional Bus / Shuttle Driver and has been driving for many years.  His occupation is one that puts him up front and personal with a special sector of our society; Bus Passengers.  Over the years he has accumulated an assortment of short stories while driving a city transit bus; he wishes to share these stories with you. Many of these stories are serious while others are mind boggling, hilarious or just make you say, Oh my gosh; what were they thinking.  
He has written this book using the following parameters: there are no swear words in this book (He doesnt need to use profanity to get his point across); he does not identify any ethnic backgrounds of the people in his stories (Marty wants people to view people without prejudice and bias) and lastly he was honest and told the truth to the best of his ability (By doing this he has found out that people dont like the truth and will go to extremes to avoid it.)
Martys writings are unique because he writes like he talks.  He does this so that he can relate to anybody who has ever told a story. The stories that he tells are inspirational, motivational and humorous.  He has become a Master Story Teller and shares his stories with all who will listen.  So get on board; Put your fare in the box; Grab a seat and be prepared for the ride of your life!

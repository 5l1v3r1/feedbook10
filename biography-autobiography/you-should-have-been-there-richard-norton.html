  <title>You Should Have Been There - Richard Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So many people have told me I should write a book because I almost always could come up with a true story for most any situation happening. So I am succumbing to all the prompting and writing down the many stories I have stored in me. It&#39;s impossible to just sit down and write everything at once. I have to wait until an event happens that triggers my memory. For instance, when I was in the army, I recorded many of the happenings of army life that I thought funny or unusual. Stories I write will mostly be about other people that happened into my life and not necessarily about me, but I was there, an observer as much as a participant. I&#39;ve relied on the opinions of generous friends who think my stories are worthwhile. I&#39;m fortunate to have crossed paths with many luminaries and have been exposed to lots of humanity, both good and bad. 
I went from high school into army intelligence for three years during the Korean War. After being discharged, I attended Wayne State University for one year and sold cars for a short while. Then I went to the Chrysler Engineering Institute. I graduated from Chrysler and became a body design engineer. After a while, big layoffs got me looking for employment again, and I went to work as a mechanical engineer for several years at companies that were into the space programs. I drifted into acting and modeling and was one of the most working models around Detroit. I was in over one hundred movies and TV commercials in that career for nineteen years and worked all over the country. 
In 1980, I moved to the Palm Beach area in Florida and, after a short time engineering again, was hired as a salesman at one of the largest art galleries in the world. I spent sixteen years at the gallery and then retired as part owner. In retirement now, I occupy my time painting, golfing, and cruising around the waters in my boat. This book is about the unusual happenings in my varied life and of the many famous people I met and worked with. Every story is true and written as best I can recollect." />

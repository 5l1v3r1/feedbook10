  <title>John Quincy Adams: Policymaker for the Union - James E. Lewis Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new book focuses on John Quincy Adams&#39;s extensive role in foreign policy, including his years as secretary of state and as president. Brief but thorough, &lt;i&gt;John Quincy Adams: Policymaker for the Union&lt;/i&gt; analyzes Adams&#39;s foreign policy accomplishments during key moments in American history, including the Rush-Bagot Agreement, the Transcontinental Treaty, the recognition of the Spanish-American republics, and the Monroe Doctrine. At the same time, the book shows that Adams was far less successful than many historians suggest.&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;John Quincy Adams: Policymaker for the Union&lt;/i&gt; focuses on Adams&#39;s ideals of the centrality of the union to American happiness, the necessity of federal action to protect the union, and the indivisibil-ity of foreign and domestic concerns. This book&#39;s examination of these three points casts new light on the logic behind many of Adams&#39;s accomplishments and also exposes the sources of some of his failures. This is the first study to examine how Adams&#39;s views ultimately led to his failure as a policymaker. This book is ideal for courses in diplomatic history, American history, and American political history." />

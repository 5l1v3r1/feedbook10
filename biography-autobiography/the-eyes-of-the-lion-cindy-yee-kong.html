  <title>The Eyes of the Lion - Cindy Yee Kong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cindy Yee Kong was a normal little girl living a normal, everyday life in Hong Konguntil a crippling genetic disease reshaped not only her body but her sense of self. She developed uncontrollable twitching and slurred speech, making even the most mundane daily tasks a challenge. Yees childhood was defined by an endless string of appointments, as doctor after doctor tried in vain to help her. Desperate, she and her mother moved to New York in the hope of a new life.
There, she faced insurmountable pressure to adapt to a new country, culture, and language. Tragically, in a home still haunted by alcoholism, her life was tainted by physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse. After a horrifying attack left her body and heart shattered, Yee struggled with shame and fear. In 1995, she was finally able to put a name to her conditiondopa-responsive dystoniaand her long path of treatment began. 
From a young age, Yee felt that the only one she could count on was herself. But then, in the midst of her darkest days, she experienced the miracle of true friends compassion and was able to begin the slow crawl out of despair. Determined not to be a victim anymore, she devoted herself to her education, earning her degree in sociology from Stony Brook University. A former social worker, Yee shares her story of pain, fear, and optimism, hoping to inspire others to push through their darkest times, too." />

From humble beginnings and a rocky partnership in her first restaurant in Brisbane in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, she charts the pain and glory of twenty years at the helm. Christine ploughed through two marriages, two solicitors, numerous accountants, hot love affairs with huge players &amp;ndash; infamous men both nationally and internationally, and dealt with the daily madness that happens both behind the kitchen doors, and front of house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet-like, she soared to fame with the launch of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Churros, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;one of Brisbane&amp;rsquo;s first suburban byo&amp;rsquo;s, moving on to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beach Caf&amp;eacute; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;on the Sunshine Coast and then the Coast&amp;rsquo;s first gourmet delicatessen. She toured the food shows in Europe in 1981 where her world &amp;ndash; and her marriage &amp;ndash; fell apart. Broke, busted, disgusted, but not beaten, she lands back in Brisbane, where from scratch again, she creates a new empire, and reaches her peak of notoriety with her iconic restaurant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possums&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; during the Fitzgerald era when silks and sharks all used to eat at her little place. She saw everything. It was New Farm, close to the Valley where seamy and sleazy met yuppies and nouveaux riches and Expo 88 was about to explode and put Brisbane on the map. She had a restaurant there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons are many, and so are the high highs, and some very low lows.&amp;nbsp;She survived. Her story is &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Confidential, Australian style. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

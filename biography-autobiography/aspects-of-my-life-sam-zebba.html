  <title>Aspects of My Life - Sam Zebba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Explorer, musician, and educator &lt;strong&gt;Sam Zebba&lt;/strong&gt; is a modern-day Renaissance Man. In humorous yet penetrating lines he recreates events which he experienced throughout his well-travelled life. &lt;em&gt;Aspects of My Life&lt;/em&gt; is a celebration of optimism, warmth, and awe toward all fellow human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bestowed with wit, realism, and knowledge, Zebba is as keen an observer as he is deeply empathetic. With the vivid portraits of those he learned from, shared with, pleaded and fought for, an epoch comes to life.&lt;br /&gt;Caroline Fetscher, historian and editor at large, Berlin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zebba writes of his experiences with the same verve and insight that he brought to his extraordinary career. In a life filled with challenges and adventure, he has filled his years with what most people only dream about.&lt;br /&gt;Prof. Ernie Rose, documentary film specialist &amp; retired Fine Arts college dean, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspect of My Life&lt;/em&gt; is a touching, evocative, beautifully observed odyssey, full of resonances and impressionistic imagery. It is the best kind of writing.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. John Lazarus, literary critic, formerly Principal of Yehudi Menuhin School, London&lt;/p&gt;" />

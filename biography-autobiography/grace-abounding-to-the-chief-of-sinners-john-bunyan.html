  <title>Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners - John Bunyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Bunyan (1628-1688) is most famously known for writing &quot;The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress&quot;, a two-part allegory of the Christian pilgrimage toward salvation. The wildly popular book was written in Bedford during Bunyan&#39;s time in prison—he was sentenced to twelve years for holding unlicensed church services. During this time Bunyan also completed an autobiography recounting the story of his own conversion from a life of sin and impiety to one of virtue and spiritual regeneration. &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot; illustrates the tenets of Puritanism through what Bunyan saw as God&#39;s saving grace in his own life. He reflects on a sinful youth, and how it led him towards an impious adulthood. Those who read the novel are comforted by Bunyan&#39;s honest admission to feelings of despair and doubt; even today, many people can identify with his struggles, and find inspiration in his faith and religious conviction." />

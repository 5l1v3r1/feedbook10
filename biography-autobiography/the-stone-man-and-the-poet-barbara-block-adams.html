  <title>The Stone Man and the Poet - Barbara Block Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Barbara Adams has created a memoir that is heartfelt and heartbreaking, peeling away the layers of a relationship that lead us to moments of stark insight and genuine humor. Its not often that a writer can deliver a personal story with this kind of simplicity and depth. A reader will leave The Stoneman and the Poet with a stronger understanding of what its like to endure both as an artist and a woman.
Laurence Carr, Editor of Riverine

Author of Pancake Hollow Primer
The Stone Man &amp; the Poet is a deeply moving memoir of a complicated marriage between a husband who is half gentle, half mad and a wife who struggles to keep her large family intact while forging her own identity as a writer. Written in a lyrical prose style and filled with wry humor, The Stone Man &amp; the Poet abounds in insights and empathy. . . 
Jeffrey Berman, Ph.D.
Author of The Talking Cure and
Empathic Teaching
This is a powerful story, told with utter honesty, realistic detail and enduring love. It recalls a dramatic period of social changes against a background of New England, New York City and upstate New York, Cape Cod, and Ireland, yet it remains a highly personal memoir that deserves a wide and attentive audience.
James Finn Cotter, Ph.D.
Author of Inscape and Translator
of Dantes The Divine Comedy
Barbara Block Adams uses the diary form to convey her own feelings and emotions quietly and convincingly in a gripping contrast to the sad experience of her husbands cancer. Her detailed descriptions of his suffering are balanced by the general information she provides about the disease and its treatment. The resulting book is both moving and useful.

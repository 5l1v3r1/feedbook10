  <title>Isabella: a Pioneer Battered Wife - Patricia Dalton-Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the town of Garnett, Kansas, in the year of 1919, most of the townspeople viewed the Kings as an idyllic couple.  They lived in a big house out at the edge of town and Andrew was reported to be a man of considerable wealth.  They thought nothing was too good for Andrews wife Isabella.  Or so they thought Many woman sighed as the handsome couple drove by in the latest motor car.  What they didnt know, is that evil lurked in the mind and heart of Andrew Jackson King.  They also didnt know that Isabella had been living a hellish nightmare for the 32 years of her marriage to Andrew.  And the smile on her face as they drove through town covered up her thoughts and the pain of yet one more day of living in this nightmare.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabellas only goal in life was to protect her son and his family from the evils of Andrew Jackson King.&lt;/p&gt;
As it turned out she was not too far away protecting herself and her family with the fatal shooting of her husband on March 9, 1919.  She was arrested on first degree murder and then spent the next two years on trial judged by an all male jury." />

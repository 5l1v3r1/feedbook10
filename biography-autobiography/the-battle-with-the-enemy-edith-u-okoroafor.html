  <title>The Battle with the Enemy - Edith U. Okoroafor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Watching the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) many years ago, when the author heard that a born-again Christian committed suicide. The Lord said to her to go tell His people in a particular church what she went through. To tell them her personal encounter with the kingdom of darkness and how she overcame through the power invested in the name of Jesus Christ. Suicides and murder are influenced by the same force of darkness which God has given us the power through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an account of what she shared with Gods people in that church. God did not keep His people here to live under the dictates of the evil one. This is a powerful book of faith and love for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though life can be difficult, God carries us through if we believe and trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />

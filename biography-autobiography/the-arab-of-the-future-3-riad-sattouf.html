  <title>The Arab of the Future 3 - Riad Sattouf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the third installment of the acclaimed series, the Sattouf family begins to implode under the pressure of Hafez al-Assad&#39;s regime and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;the suffocation of their rural Syrian village.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/i&gt; is the widely acclaimed, internationally bestselling graphic memoir that tells the story of Riad Sattouf&#39;s peripatetic childhood in the Middle East. In the first volume, which covers the years 1978-1984, his family moves between rural France, Libya, and Syria, where they eventually settle in his father&#39;s native village of Ter Maaleh, near Homs. The second volume recounts young Riad&#39;s first year attending school in Syria (1984-1985), where he dedicates himself to becoming a true Syrian in the country of Hafez al-Assad. In this third volume, (1985-1987), Riad&#39;s mother, fed up with the grinding reality of daily life in the village, decides she cannot take it any longer. When she resolves to move back to France, young Riad sees his father torn between his wife&#39;s aspirations and the weight of family traditions.&lt;/p&gt;" />

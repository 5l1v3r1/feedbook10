  <title>The Force of Things - Alexander Stille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A masterpiece of literary memory--a powerful exploration of the intersections of family, history, and memory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One evening in May 1948, my mother went to a party in New York with her first husband and left it with her second, my father.&quot; So begins the passionate and stormy union of Mikhail Kamenetzki, aka Ugo Stille, one of Italy&#39;s most celebrated journalists, and Elizabeth Bogert, a beautiful and charming young woman from the Midwest. &lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Force of Things&lt;/i&gt; follows two families across the twentieth century--one starting in czarist Russia, the other starting in the American Midwest--and takes them across revolution, war, fascism, and racial persecution, until they collide at mid-century. Their immediate attraction and tumultuous marriage is part of a much larger story: the mass migration of Jews from fascist-dominated Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. It is a micro-story of that moment of cross-pollination that reshaped much of American culture and society. Theirs was an uneasy marriage between Europe and America, between Jew and WASP; their differences were a key to their bond yet a source of constant strife. &lt;br&gt;     Alexander Stille&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Force of Things&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, beautifully written work with the intimacy of a memoir, the pace and readability of a novel, and the historical sweep and documentary precision of nonfiction writing at its best. It is a portrait of people who are buffeted about by large historical events, who try to escape their origins but find themselves in the grip of the force of things.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Rough Around the Edges - Jerome Ralston, Carol N. Arkley, Kimberly Ralston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rough Around the Edges&lt;br&gt;
Jerome and Kimberly Ralston&lt;br&gt;
with Carol Arkley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Written with utmost brilliance, it chronicles an amazing couple, Jay and Kim Ralston, who has faced some great adversities in their lives--some of which they are still dealing with. They have gone from starting with nothing to becoming millionaires to losing everything except their faith in God and their love for each other. They have not given up and have faced overwhelming challenges with determination and a positive attitude on their climb back to the top. 
Informative, insightful, and life changing, this thirty-chapter book of short stories reveal many emotions in life that are worth reading all over again. Immerse yourself with Ralstons &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rough Around the Edges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; and find yourself inspired. 
by Jerome &amp; Kimberly Ralston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Two newly married young professionals decided they wanted a fresh direction in life.  With little preparation and a lot of guts, this dynamic couple elected to resign from their jobs and start their own business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a few dollars and no cents, they embarked upon the American Dream. They began their service enterprise with hope, love, and pure faith, eventually realizing they could never turn back.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Success did not come easy, however; there were financial roller coasters, betrayals, jealousies, joys, births, and even deaths. Sometimes there were high peaks, other times, low valleys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This team has stories to share with entrepreneurs, couples, and families.  They hope that their twenty-two years of marriage and business will fill your minds and hearts with a just do it attitude.  They believe that if you wait for the perfect moment, it may never come.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You only have one body, one mind, and one lifemake it your best one! We gave it our best, and you can too, although sometimes it may be . . . rough around the edges." />

  <title>We Are a Family  3 - Bob Traley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &quot;We Are A Family&quot; series IS NOT about any rich or famous people. It IS a factual account of how ONE FAMILY is living out the Christian life of the Creator&#39;s processes of JUSTIFICATION, SANTIFICATION, and eventual GLORIFICATION. His desire and love for us, along with His gift of FREE WILL, causes each of us to live a life on Earth of &quot;ups&quot; and &quot;downs&quot;, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Each of these experiences allow us to either grow closer to Him through PRAISE and THANKSGIVING or farther from Him by SELF GLORIFICATION of our successes and BLAME of Him for our tribulations.
Part 1 covers the years 1873-1975. Part 2 covers 1976-1982. Part 3 covers 1983-1988.
It is hoped that the book will inspire the reader to record a similar collection of &quot;successes&quot; and &quot;failures&quot; of their own family members as a LEGACY for future generations.
Bob began his &quot;Tour of Earth&quot; in Kingston, NY in 1932. After High School the U.S. Navy provided him with both educational and experiential knowledge. His adult life with various Fortune 500 corporations provided extensive worldwide travel. At the time of Part-3 publication, he and his wife are residing on Hutchinson Island, FL while the children and grandchildren are pursuing their &quot;Tour&quot; across the U.S.A." />

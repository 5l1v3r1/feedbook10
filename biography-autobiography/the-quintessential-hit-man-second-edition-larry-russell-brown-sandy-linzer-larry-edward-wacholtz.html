  <title>The Quintessential Hit Man (Second Edition) - Larry Russell Brown, Sandy Linzer, Larry Edward Wacholtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s been slapped by Frank Sinatra, hugged by John Lennon, and ridiculed by The Beatles&amp;rsquo; record label. It all happened over his song &lt;em&gt;Tie a Yellow Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &amp;lsquo;round the Ole Oak Tree&lt;/em&gt; that ignited emotions of love, patriotism, and forgiveness in billions of fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Newark, New Jersey, Larry Russell Brown stole food to feed himself and his six brothers and sisters. His enterprising methods including stealing a car that landed him in jail at age eleven in the State Home for Boys at Jamesburg, which was one of the toughest detainment centers for kids in the 1950&amp;rsquo;s. L. Russell Brown often says, &amp;quot;If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for music, I&amp;rsquo;d be dead or probably be selling hot dogs for the Witness Protection program . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting my childhood destroy me, I let it help me become who I am. I took every tear I felt in my childhood and turned it into musical notes. I turned every punch in the face from my father and smashed it into a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown wrote songs every day and pitched them to music publishers who turned him and his co-writers down more often than a cheap motel bed. Brown got his first serious break when he was signed as a songwriter by the legendary producer Bob Crewe. His songs have sold more than 200 million recordings. And L. Russell Brown is still incredibly active in the creation of new music today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Man of the Year - Lou Cove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Hilarious and poignant&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;People &lt;/i&gt;Magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one 1970&#39;s family, the center may not hold, but it certainly does fold.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978 Jimmy Carter mediates the Camp David Accords, Fleetwood Mac tops charts with &lt;i&gt;Rumours&lt;/i&gt;, Starsky fights crime with Hutch, and twelve-year-old Lou Cove is uprooted from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Salem, Massachusetts- a backwater town of witches, Puritans, and sea-captain wannabes. After his eighth move in a dozen years, Lou figures he should just resign himself to a teenage purgatory of tedious paper routes, school bullies, and unrequited lust for every girl he likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then one October morning an old friend of Lou&#39;s father, free-wheeling (and free-loving) Howie Gordon arrives at the Cove doorstep from California with his beautiful wife Carly. Howie is everything Lou wants to be: handsome as a movie star, built like a god and in possession of an unstoppable confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, over Thanksgiving dinner, Howie drops a bombshell. Holding up an issue of &lt;i&gt;Playgirl&lt;/i&gt; Magazine, he flips to the center and there he is, Mr. November in all his natural glory. Howie has his eye on becoming the next Burt Reynolds, and a wild idea for how to do it: win &lt;i&gt;Playgirl&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Man of the Year.  And he knows just who should manage his campaign. As Lou and Howie canvas Salem for every vote in town - little old ladies at bridge club, the local town witch, construction workers on break and everyone in between - Lou is forced to juggle the perils of adolescence with the pursuit of Hollywood stardom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Man of the Year&lt;/i&gt; is the improbable true story of Lou&#39;s thirteenth year, one very unusual campaign, and the unexpected guest who changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />

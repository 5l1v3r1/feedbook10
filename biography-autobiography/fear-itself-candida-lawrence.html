  <title>Fear Itself - Candida Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In light of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan, the remarkable personal story that comprises Fear Itself becomes a cautionary tale.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unwittingly exposed to low-level radiation in the 1940s, Candida Lawrence has lived courageously with its effects throughout her life. Fear Itself traces her years struggling to have a child and her slow waking to the secrets that governments and institutions withheld from the women of her generation. The task for her&amp;#151;and for women who have shared her experience&amp;#151;has always been to believe herself into wholeness and to survive her losses and her illnesses until there is nothing left to fear. As always, Lawrence&amp;#8217;s writing is filled with smart, gentle anger, sweet sadness and the most private sense of what is vital and important.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Fear Itself, Lawrence&amp;#8217;s deeply felt remembrances grant us an honest account of what it is to live in an unstable world. It is a truly personal account that sheds wide light on the world&amp;#8217;s ongoing nuclear decisions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What personal life story could be more timely?&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Dedah Queen - Eliza Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you the family historian?  Then this is the book for you.  Have you ever wanted to get to the root of your familys history?  This book is a compilation of three generations made available with family trees, revealing untold family secrets.
Revealing untold family secrets, for the very first time, will cause you to laugh, cry, and become a part of these special people. The results of these never before shared stories will become therapeutic for the family and inadvertently encourage you the curious reader.
The story of Dedah Queen (pronounced dere the queen) begins with a girl who was a Gullah speaking African American, living in Cross, South Carolina, who became a hard working mother, and grandmother. Her wisdom will make you shake your head as you read how she worked as a housemaid living on $25.00 dollars a week, in the twentieth century. Her survival as a spiritual woman who played the piano at church by day, and the boogie woogie, in her private chambers by night, will no doubt bring tears to your eyes. A deep dark secret of romance will unfold. And finally, with no formal education, this lovely lady left common sense sayings about life for all of us to use and to be encouraged by." />

  <title>The Melting of the Golden Spoon - Michael E. Mitzelfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through my ability to listen I constantly hear how middle class people are disgusted with our society and wonder where it all went wrong. This book takes you through my own life experiences and stories of frustration I have encountered along the way. I translate throught the eyes of the common man how the country has digressed since 1969 the year I was brought into this world. The book depicts how things used to be compared to today and a few off the wall subjects we think about as well. It also expresses the opinions of the people about the state of our country and their anger toward corporate greed and our government. Like it or not I am getting it out there for everyone to hear. There are some touchy subjects that are considered taboo to speak about but I do believe we have freedom of speech don&#39;t we? Agree to disagree but everyone has an opinion that counts whether it be politically correct or not. I warn you my writings are not sugar coated and tell it like it is. I know everyone will be able to relate in some way and even crack a smile or shed a tear in between." />

From an early age, he learned to rely on himself and his Italian-American instincts for survival, which served him well when he was drafted into World War II and sent to the South Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told by his granddaughter, this life story of a courageous sailor celebrates Parisis many achievements  from surviving the Great Depression as a youth, to marrying the love of his life, serving his country, and later becoming a mechanic. His life story is proof that no matter how big or small the goal, determination achieves results, whether its fixing a car or surviving a war.&lt;/p&gt;" />

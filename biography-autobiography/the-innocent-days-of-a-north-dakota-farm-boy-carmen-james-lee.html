  <title>The Innocent Days of a North Dakota Farm Boy - Carmen James Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was a time of innocence for author Carmen James Lee, growing up on a rural farm in North Dakota in the 1950s. In The Innocent Days of a North Dakota Farm Boy, he shares a nostalgic collection of stories telling about his experiences as a child during a much simpler time. In this memoir, he narrates how he walked in the fresh snow to milk the cows with a kerosene lantern in his hand, what it was like attending a one-room school, and how he sawed a huge hay stack in half with a rope made of barbwire. Recalling a fun-filled youth, Lee tells about his challenges, his dream, his successes, and his failures.  The Innocent Days of a North Dakota Farm Boy shares real-life stories of a North Dakota boy growing up and experiencing these and many more fun and exciting things-from plowing with a tiny, two-bottom plow behind the Ford tractor to marching in the school band at the Indianapolis 500 car race." />

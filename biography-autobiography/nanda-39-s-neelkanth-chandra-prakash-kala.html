  <title>Nanda&#39;s Neelkanth - Chandra Prakash Kala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being blessed to wander in some of the most fascinating hills and valleys of nature, I have been endeavoring for long to put these stories together. I offer here the elements that appeal most to me during my wanderings in the jungles, meadows, villages and towns, especially in the abode of gods and goddesses  the Himalaya.&lt;p&gt;I pick up one of the tales as a title of the book &#39;Nanda&#39;s Neelkanth&#39;. Neelkanth is one of the several names of the Lord Shiva, the Hindu god. Many snow-clad peaks of the Himalaya are named after the gods and goddesses and Neelkanth is one of the most magnificent peaks. It attracts every human soul not only to its brilliant hues and majestic snowy peak but Neelkanth, as the Mahadev, also remains the source of spirituality for billions. Likewise, His consort, Nanda who is adorned with innumerable names including the Gaura, has been venerated in the form of beautiful mountains of the Himalaya. The quiet and unquiet woods, the elusive and elegant wildlife, the people and their culture and their struggle for living are the other elements in this bouquet of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Dear Reflection - Jessica Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessica Bell never meant to be a rebel. But growing up with two gothic rockers as parents seemed to make it inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980s&amp;nbsp;Australia, Erika Bach and Demetri Vlass founded Ape the Cry and Hard Candy, two of Melbourne&amp;rsquo;s iconic indie bands. They encouraged Jessica with unreserved love to pick up the guitar and write her own songs. But Erika&amp;rsquo;s back problem became a nightmare of pill popping, alcohol abuse, and anxiety attacks. Demetri retreated into silence for fear of triggering Erika&amp;rsquo;s drug-induced psychosis. And Jessica turned inwards, to her own reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her mirror self was a fiend, not a friend. All it took was one secret drink at fifteen, and Jessica dove headlong into depression and self-destruction to escape the madness at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with bisexuality in a high school rife with bullies? Not a problem; she had alcohol. Losing her virginity to rape? Not a problem; she had alcohol. Trying to supplement absent love with unprotected one-night stands? Not a problem; she had alcohol ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one day alcohol nearly drove Jessica off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica had to look at herself honestly and frankly. Why did she keep running from reality, and more importantly, herself?&lt;/p&gt;" />

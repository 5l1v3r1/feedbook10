  <title>I Was Just Passing Through - Cassandra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I decided to write this autobiography, a strange feeling overcame me, wondering why I should reveal my innermost and carefully protected memories that had lain dormant for so many years and expose them now to the world.  However, others  kept encouraging me to share my saga of growing up during very difficult times in the world, as well as personal circumstances of instability in which I often felt like I was walking about in a haze.  Jokes about blondes being dumb might have applied at times but do blondes really have more fun?  I leave that to you, dear reader, to decide. 
This haze finally forced me to use an undeveloped creativity I never knew I had that led to amazing, unexpected and unusual events, and changed the direction of my life completely.  My  hope is that upon reading this, no matter how difficult and unfair life is or may seem to be, such moments can serve as stepping stones that force us to become creative in making make a life that becomes more exciting and worthwhile. We have the gift of life and there truly is no time like the present to hope and achieve for something better, whether young or elderly.  Some of my finest accomplishments took place later in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, this book would never have been written without the help of others.  Memories of loved ones who have passed on who taught and guided me out of a labyrinth of despair at times will forever remain in my heart as my greatest treasures. They are as live to me today in my memory as when they were here." />

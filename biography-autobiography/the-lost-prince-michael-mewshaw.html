  <title>The Lost Prince - Michael Mewshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;At once a moving story of friendship, a memoir, a biography, and an attempt to come to peace with a deeply camouflaged author, Pat Conroy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pat Conroy was America&#39;s poet laureate of family dysfunction. A larger-than-life character and the author of such classics as &lt;i&gt;The Prince of Tides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Great Santini&lt;/i&gt;, Pat was remembered by everybody for his energy, his exuberance, his self-lacerating humor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Michael Mewshaw&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Lost Prince&lt;/i&gt; is an intimate memoir of his friendship with Pat Conroy, one that involves their families and those days in Rome when they were both young—when Conroy went from being a popular regional writer to an international best-seller. Shortly before his 49th birthday, Conroy telephoned Mewshaw to ask a terrible favor. With great reluctance Mewshaw did as he was asked—and never saw Pat Conroy again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although they never managed to reconcile their differences completely, Conroy later urged Michael to &quot;write about you and me and what happened . . . I know it would cause much pain to both of us but here is what the story has that none of the others have.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Lost Prince&lt;/i&gt; is Mewshaw&#39;s fulfillment of a promise." />

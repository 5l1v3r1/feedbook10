  <title>How Precious Was That While - Piers Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Piers Anthony tells his own remarkable life story in this candid autobiography, a volume that is sure to intrigue and entertain his many fans-and infuriate his critics. The book begins with a review of the author&#39;s early years, revealing new and telling details about his upbringing at the hands of two brilliant but often careless parents, including a riveting section about their harrowing experiences as expatriates in Spain just before the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of the book focuses on the past fifteen years since &lt;i&gt;Bio of an Ogre&lt;/i&gt; (the first volume of his autobiography) was published, a time both of personal progress and professional frustration for Anthony, as his works became increasingly ambitious while his sales began to slow. He offers cautionary tales on the pitfalls of the &quot;bottom line&quot; publishing mentality, as well as scathing portraits of several well-known publishing figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candid, opinionated and endlessly fascinating, &lt;i&gt;How Precious Was That While i&lt;/i&gt;s an intimate self-portrait by one of the most intriguing writers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This unsparingly forthright second memoir should ruffle some feathers that badly need ruffling.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

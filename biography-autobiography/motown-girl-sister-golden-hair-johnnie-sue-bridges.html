  <title>Motown Girl Sister Golden Hair - Johnnie Sue Bridges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Johnnie Sue Bridges incredible life story began with the release of her first book, the highly acclaimed Shadows And Scars, a beautiful story that captures the essence of living in the mountains of Middlesboro, Kentucky, with vivid imagery, comical moments and raw emotion. In one cold blue night, she writes of an already painful world turning into nothing short of a nightmare. Bitter coldness and survival starts the reader on a journey that portrays a young mothers fight against poverty, loneliness, and alcoholism, concluding in the riot-torn and racially divided city of Detroit. Shadows And Scars reveals a birds-eye view of the child that struggled to maintain stability in her hauntingly unstable world. Readers will gain the knowledge of endurance within themselves, despite adversity.
Book # 2 Motown Girl Sister Golden Hair chronicles her roller coaster ride through the early 70s growing up in the inner city of Detroits Westside. Hitting the teen years during the underground time of extreme change, uprisings, experimenting with everything under the sun, came at a very high pricerobbery of her self worth and most importantly, the stolen innocence of the ones she dearly loved. Highly educated in cultured urban habit, she was forevermore restless and ran incessantly. And by the grace of God, she eventually changed and escaped. However, some of those she held closest to her heart paid the piper with their lives.  
In her own words, No one told us that stuff would kill ya.
Book # 3 of the series
Run BabyGirl Run
Just Published!
The year was 1973. A fourteen-year-old girl hitchhiked across the
country to the Pacific Coast, then back to the Atlantic Ocean. Her
mother died when she was only eleven years old and never knowing
a father, there had to be a way of validating her very existence and to
discover why she was on this planet. The answers were all around her;
however, she would not be able to recognize them until years later.
Meeting with many life-threatening situations, its a thousand wonders
she is still alive to tell her story. Run BabyGirl Run is written with gutwrenching
honesty and allows the reader to see into the very depths of
this beautiful young girls soul.

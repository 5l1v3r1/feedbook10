      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The day Dr. Anthony Zaccaglin suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), he and his family could not begin to fathom the horrific impact his accident would have. After his TBI stripped him of his career, his skills, and much of his identity, Anthony was forced to embark on a formidable journey of overcoming disappointment and frustration on his way to rediscovery&amp;mdash;a journey he continues to this day. From diagnosis to rehab to resuming &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; life, he has made an arduous climb up the mountain of recovery to regain functionality not just in his brain, but also in his relationships. Despite many setbacks, Anthony has pushed on and learned valuable lessons about recovery and how to achieve the ultimate post-TBI goal: a renewed purpose in life. In &lt;em&gt;The Real Deal&lt;/em&gt;, he shares his incredible story to educate readers about the reality of TBIs and, most importantly, encourage any who are suffering from one: &amp;ldquo;You are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a brain injury; you are just a person who has suffered one!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Through the Eyes of the Lizard - Steven James Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through The Eyes Of The Lizard, a book conceptionalized and written by Steve Smith is the Ralph Waldo Emerson of the pool and billiard world. Steve Smith, affectionaly known as sneaky Lizard explains and demonstrates the metaphysical-spiritual sense of competitive pool combat always knowing he will win and take down the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneaky Lizard, writes from his heart, and soul and is completely truthful with respect to all the events and characterization throughout the book. Steve Smith is a genius, even as a pool hustler. As Emerson stated: Each of us has been born with a genius. There is something that each of us do very well. It has been assigned to us, and yet many of us every really pause in life to discover it deeply and then apply the other necessary ingredient. And that is drill. That is practice. That is taking that which is good and making it great. That is pursuing your niche. That is unveiling your uniqueness. That is finding your voice and learning how to vocalize -not like everybody else- but your way. that requires you to at times to swim upstream, to go against the flow, to stand out in the crowd declaring--Here I am, here is what I offer to create a much better world, -that is now better because I have not hidden my gift--and have risked rejection by bringing it forth in public.&lt;/p&gt;

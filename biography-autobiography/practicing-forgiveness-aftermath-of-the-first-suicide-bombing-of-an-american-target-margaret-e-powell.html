  <title>Practicing Forgiveness:  Aftermath of the First Suicide Bombing of an American Target - Margaret E. Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;The massive truck bomb that destroyed the American Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 targeted the symbol of the United States in Lebanon.  The why and how of that terrorist incident have frequently been explored.  The human consequences have received less attention.  In her book, &quot;Practicing Forgiveness: Aftermath of the First Suicide Bombing of an American Target&quot; Margaret Powell has written movingly about those human consequences.  She describes what happened to the McIntyre family when their husband and father, my friend and colleague, Bill McIntyre was killed. Mrs. Powell rushed from the United States to Beirut to care for Bills widow, also injured in the attack, and bring her home.  Her story touched me deeply with its pathos, humor, courage, and compassion.  A wonderful book.&quot;

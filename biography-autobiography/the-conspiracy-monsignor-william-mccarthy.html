  <title>The Conspiracy - Monsignor William McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Conspiracy&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the monumental struggles of an innocent priest, &lt;b&gt;Monsignor William McCarthy&lt;/b&gt;, falsely accused in 2003 of molesting two young sisters more than 23 years earlier. On the eve of his retirement from a stellar career as a priest and pastor, for the next five tortuous years, he was the victim of an anonymous complaint that was accepted as true by his bishop and friend of 40 years. Share his travails and see how ones faith can overcome the worst injustices that man can heap on a holy and totally innocent person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Jack Kraft, Esq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsignor William McCarthy paints a picture embracing a situation that is almost impossible to comprehend. Had I not stood by him throughout the years of pure hell he experienced, I would not have believed the outright calumny by a detective, and how the subsequent action of his bishop and diocesan staff could have occurred. Child abuse is a terrible thing, but equally horrible is when innocent priests are unjustly condemned and destroyed by the hierarchy of their church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Arthur N. Hoagland, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a must read for any Catholic who loves their Church but is concerned about its often self-destructive response to the tragedy of clerical pedophilia. It is story about tragedy and triumph. The tragedy of the Church that Monsignor McCarthy loves deeply, and into which he has selflessly devoted his entire life, but is sometimes governed by people who have lost all sense of justice. It is a Church that betrayed him. In its attempt to protect the victims of child abuse, it established a new category of victims: its faithful priests. The triumph of Monsignor McCarthy is his faith and love of Jesus, which saw him through his terrible ordeal in spite of the evil that was perpetrated against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Deacon Joseph Keenan&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>God in the Outback - Jo Bourne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jo Bourne lost her beloved husband, Bill, she worried that she had also lost her way in life and her will to live. With her children raised and living on their own, she knew that she was at a crossroads in her life. Then one day, she got a message from God telling her to become a missionary in Australia, and she set out on a new path. God in the Outback tells the inspiring story of a woman who longed to bring the word of God to those in need and who found her way to Australia with Gods help and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew that she wanted to make a positive difference in the lives of people by bringing Gods word to them. At first, the trip and the financial obligations involved in getting her there seemed daunting, but with God there is always hope and her prayers were answered time and time again. As she adjusted to the culture and learned of the racial discrimination that existed there, she worked toward her purpose of reaching out and ministering to the Aboriginal children in the white community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in this memoir, Bourne recounts her experiences in Australia during her mission, chronicling the good, the challenges, and the wondrous feeling of making a difference in the lives of many people.&lt;/p&gt;

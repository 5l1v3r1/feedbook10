  <title>The Cuban Lightning - Julio Antonio del Marmol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Julio Antonio del Marmol joined thousands of others who escaped Castros regime in Cuba. But unlike his peers, he becomes a spy and freedom fighter, working with intelligence services throughout the world.
He leads one of the largest covert money-printing operations in history. This operation, codenamed The Zipper, was created to finance counterterrorism and covert operations all over the world. Its his job to supervise a team that creates millions of dollars in US currency. 
Everything is going well until a trusted friend sets del Marmol up, pointing to him as a counterfeiter. Even though he has the undocumented sanction of government intelligence services, hes disavowed and abandoned. Facing a seventy-year sentence, he refuses to betray his team members. Sitting in jail, cut off from his contacts, he hatches a plan to escapeeven as the Secret Service does everything in its power to convict him and send him away for life.
Join a ghost agent who knew Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevaraonly to see family and friends killed by their regime. He gets his revenge, but its a battle just to stay alive in The Cuban Lightning." />

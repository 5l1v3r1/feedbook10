Given that prison walls have surrounded him in his seventieth year, as in his fiftieth, and given his illness later in the year, no easy celebration can be indulged.&#39;  Beginning with an editorial, it includes poems, interspersed between fiction and commentary; a moving interview with an ex-prisoner and poet is accompanied by essays in scholarly criticism. Most of the contributors are Irish, because the idea for the book originated with the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.

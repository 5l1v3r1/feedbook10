  <title>There Is Always a Reason to Dance - Dick Coupe, Barbara Coupe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We were blessed to grow up in Roman Catholic families, and were married in the Church in 1960. Barb gave birth to six children during the next ten years. During this time, we made eight physical household moves, four of the relocations were made with newborn babies in tow! In 1974, we made the difficult decision to leave the Catholic Church, and have been actively involved in Bible Churches ever since.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who would believe our schedule? We participated in every type of volunteer service available, including: basketball and soccer coach, Girl Scout leader, Sunday school teachers, and always time for family dinners. Barb was a stay-at-home mom, and eventually achieved an Interior Design degree. I worked for one employer for almost 50 years, which included five different companies, and positions from Apprentice to Director.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now comes our together time. In 1985, Barb started to accompany me on business travel trips. We have traveled extensively: Europe, Canada, Alaska, Mexico, Caribbean, China, Russia and South Africa. Along the way, we have owned 36 automobiles, one truck and one motorcycle. Please come along for the ride of our lifetimes; we hope that you will enjoy it half as much as we have!&lt;/P&gt;" />

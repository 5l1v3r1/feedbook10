  <title>Jumping off the Devil’S Shovel - Renate v.K. Ruzich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In early January of 1945, the horror of the Eastern Front inched ever closer to the estate of Stollen, East Prussia. The regional governor refused to allow soldiers and civilians to evacuate as the Soviet Army approached, and orders were given to &quot;shoot on sight&quot; those found fleeing the approaching terror. It was not until January 22 that evacuation was allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renate von Kuenheim and her brother Gert held hands as they stood in the barns of their ancestral home in Stollen. The thunder of artillery shells echoed in the distance, and fear gave way to resignation. Calmly, they discussed the best ways to die, a common topic among those who had heard the horror stories of the refugees from the east. Their father had been drafted into the army in 1944 and was out there to the east somewhere  alive or dead, they did not know. Their fate was now in the hands of a stepmother who despised them.  As head of the estate, she was tasked with making decisions for their family and the twenty-three families serving the estate. Their stepmother resolutely refused to leave until, on January 23, nobody was there to take her call at the local Nazi headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renate von Kuenheim&#39;s terrifying flight westward began the next day. Separated from her family and their villagers by the scheming of her stepmother, the beautiful seventeen-year-old Renate was left alone, with only her horse Tasha, the clothes on her back, a knife, and the pistol her father had taught her to shoot with. Her remarkable flight toward freedom lays before the reader, tales of the horrors of war, the strength of the human spirit and the love that can grow between a horse and master. It is a true story many readers may find unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;" />

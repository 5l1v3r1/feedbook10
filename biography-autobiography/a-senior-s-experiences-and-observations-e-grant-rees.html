  <title>A Senior’S Experiences and Observations - E. Grant Rees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lifes challenges become more difficult with age, especially those older than 60 years of age who Ill call seniors. These challenges include health issues, moving, getting good medical care, caregiving, and coping with various forms of stress. The chapters herein discuss these problems including personal experiences with the medical and health care systems, experiences as a caregiver, and the stress caused by all of the political conflicts and scandals as the world around us is changing at an accelerating pace. These stresses are particularly difficult for seniors. The honesty and trust of people, including government and medical personnel, lawyers, and the public in general becomes overwhelming at times when it seems that the situations are getting worse, and not being resolved.
It is hoped that the information presented herein will help others when faced with similar issues." />

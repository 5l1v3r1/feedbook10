  <title>Buffalo Bill - Colonel William F. Cody, William B. ,Jr. Jones, William B. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The greatest adventure story of all time is the story of the American West. Of all the scouts whose unflinching courage blazed the trail of that wilderness, the most celebrated was William Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill. William F. Cody was born in the middle of the nineteenth century on the plains of Kansas Territory where his family had settled to trade with the friendly Kickapoo Tribe. These Natives were Bill&#39;s childhood playmates and at a tender age he traded his brand-new buckskin suit for a little wild Indian pony that he learned to ride like the wind. By the time he was twelve, he was doing the work of a grown man as a cattle driver, camping under the stars each night. When he was caught in a buffalo stampede his horsemanship saved his life. Then he met wilderness scout Kit Carson who taught him how to read the language of the plains. When daredevil riders were needed to carry the mail on the new Pony Express, Bill was one of the first to sign up. Then the Civil War began and Bill went East to fight for Kansas, since that state wanted nothing to do with slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimized for Kindle devices and featuring Panel Zoom facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its beginnings in the 1940&#39;s to today, Classics Illustrated continues to encourage a love of reading and adventure in youthful minds through beautifully-illustrated comic book adaptations of the world&#39;s most beloved stories by the world&#39;s greatest authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of Classics Illustrated books is an inviting start to any young person&#39;s library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;" />

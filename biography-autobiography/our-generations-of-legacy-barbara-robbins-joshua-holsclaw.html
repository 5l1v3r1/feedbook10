  <title>Our Generations of Legacy - Barbara Robbins, Joshua Holsclaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Legacy- Walk a mile in my shoes, live where Ive lived, dwell in my experiences, learn from my mistakes, and then decide where to go in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a role model, and for Barbara Robbins and Joshua Holsclaw, their role models are four grandmothers who founded a legacy prosperous of spirituality. Lou Watts, Emma Carswell, Callie Lail, and Bessie Lail were average Southerners; however, their lives are seen with a new perspective when examined in depth. They remained dedicated to serving the Lord and provided for their families no matter what circumstances occurred. It was these sacrifices that instilled love in the hearts of their children as they passed down valuable lessons, raised their families on morality, and allowed their lights to shine before their loved ones. Because of the Lord, these trees have firm foundations, but these womens influences make the trees blossom with beauty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Throughout the pages of this memoir, the authors examine the measures these four grandmothers took to establish their family trees, the faith passed through each generation of this lineage, and the principles of family and dedication. Youll find a mother sewing outfits by hand for her children past midnight, a leader walking several miles to church, parents doing without so their children could have Christmas gifts, and a giant of the faith remaining fervent in prayer for her loved ones. The inspiration and challenge will give every family the lens to examine their own lives and the true meaning behind family.&lt;/p&gt;" />

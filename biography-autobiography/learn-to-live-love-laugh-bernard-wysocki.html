  <title>Learn to Live, Love, Laugh - Bernard Wysocki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be thankful for today every day. We can only live today, not yesterday again, not yet tomorrow. Remind yourself how precious today is. It will go by fast, so dont squander it. Look around you and live in the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born on Valentines Day in 1939, author Bernard Wysocki has had a love affair with life. Though it wasnt all roses and champagne, he has met each challenge with wit and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernards memoir, Learn to Live, Love, Laugh, is part recollection, part philosophy, and part narrative. In part one, Bernard shares stories of his early years growing up in Chicago, of how he met Jesse Owens in 1951, of his road trip to Florida after high school, and several other heartwarming adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part two reveals Bernards down-to-earth beliefs on what he has learned over the years. From giving thanks and starting the day positively to finding happiness within and the importance of faithfulness, Bernard offers a great deal of food for thought. Part three is a collection of short stories, some humorous and others seeking to understand morality and religion.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A compendium of personal history and universal wisdom, Learn to Live, Love, Laugh is sure to touch your heart for years to come.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

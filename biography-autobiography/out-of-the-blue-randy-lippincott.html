  <title>Out of the Blue - Randy Lippincott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an exciting autobiography about Randys gripping skydiving career that began in the 60s. His adventure started where Charles Lindbergh made his first three jumps. Inspired by a Medal of Honor recipient, Randy joined Special Forces and trained as a combat medic.
Assigned to the Seventh Army Parachute Team in Europe, Randy fell desperately in love and later felt beguiled. He used sex, drugs, and alcohol to drown his sorrows. Randy jumped in a thunderstorm and through a ten-thousand-foot cloud, narrowly surviving each. This captivating story is about death, hijacking, murder, flat spins, drugs, counterfeiting, a deadly motorcycle accident, a high-speed car chase, and a time-loss experience. Lippincott started skydiving again in preparation to write this bookit was 13,852 days between jumps.
 Randys fantastic tale is a story filled with passion, failure, determination, success, heartache, awakening, and at last sweet redemption. It is about skydiving adventures, but it is much more than that. It describes a generation, the baby boomers that rebelled in the 60s with free love. The narrative chronicles a person who did not want to live in quiet desperation but would rather push the envelope and test the waters." />

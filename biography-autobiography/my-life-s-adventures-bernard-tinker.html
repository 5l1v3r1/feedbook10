  <title>“My Life’S Adventures” - Bernard Tinker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book deals with situations of living through the German occupation of Norway from 1940, including shortages of food and heat, all under a threatening occupation by the Hitlerite German Army. My father was imprisoned in Germany for five years while we survived without his strength and abilities. At eleven years old, I escaped imprisonment or death when caught by a German soldier in the wrong place.
The story moves to a totally different environment in Nigeria, with another culture that was about to be changed by the removal of British control. This gives a picture of the beginning of large changes. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip attended the liberation ceremony in Benin.
This book also includes a number of images of the life of the African and English cultures. This includes the problems of living with noxious tropical diseases and pests.
Bernard returned to Britain to continue work and studies but, unfortunately, developed a serious disease, cerebral vasculitis, that they did not think he would survive. Fortunately, he has and is still active." />

  <title>Glimpses of Life - James Stephen Fulbright Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Glimpses of Life is the result of James Stephen Fulbrights observation, imagination, and memory to view his world objectively. This work has been inspired by real people and real events. The people who inspired him were his relatives and close friends and an occasional stranger. He has nothing but praise for them and gratitude to them for making his life interesting and complete along with the lives of his kinsmen and friends, contributing to making life rich and full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in time-span, these stories begin with the earliest stories taking place about 1740 and the most recent stories concluding about 1965 and some even as recent as 2014 counting the time during which he is looking back. He is offering stories, ones that can be read separately or read together. Because the stories can be read separately, he has them divided into chapters, and because they are less than whole entities, he presents them not as wholly comprehensible in and of themselves, but rather as, in view of the rich texture of real life, short glimpsesglimpses of life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To bring in other points of view in Glimpses of Life with concern for meaning and understanding, he has created a narrative that delves into values and meanings that profile the glimpses of his life story.&lt;/p&gt;" />

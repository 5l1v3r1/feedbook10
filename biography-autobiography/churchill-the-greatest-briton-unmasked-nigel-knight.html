  <title>Churchill the Greatest Briton Unmasked - Nigel Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I have not always been wrong. History will bear me out, particularly as I shall write that history myself.&quot;&amp;#151Winston Churchill&lt;p&gt;In the popular imagination, Winston Churchill is the greatest Briton. He was the lone voice that warned of the threat from Nazi Germany and the steady and defiant hand that guided Britain through its darkest days to ultimate victory in World War II.&lt;p&gt;In this new assessment of Churchill&#39;s political life, Nigel Knight reveals that not only is there little truth in this picture of his wartime Premiership but that Churchill&#39;s record during this period fitted a pattern of disastrous strategy and bad decision-making that dogged his entire career.&lt;p&gt;From the debacle of the Gallipoli campaign in World War I, when First Lord of the Admiralty, to the tired and ineffective last government of the 1950s, Churchill&#39;s time in office was characterized by inconsistency and poor judgment. Particularly during World War II, he seemed unable to see the bigger picture, exasperating his colleagues as he ignored their advice in favor of his own pet projects.&lt;p&gt;Backed up by rigorous research, Nigel Knight sheds startling new light on the life and career of Winston Churchill, shattering the sentimental myth of Churchill as &#39;the greatest Briton&#39; and forcing his legacy to be reappraised." />

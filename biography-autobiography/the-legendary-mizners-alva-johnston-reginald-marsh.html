  <title>The Legendary Mizners - Alva Johnston, Reginald Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real-life adventures of Addison and Wilson Mizner, the subjects of the Stephen Sondheim musical &lt;i&gt;Gold!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alva Johnston&#39;s joint biography of Addison and Wilson Mizner is a delightful portrait of two of the early twentieth century&#39;s most clever and infamous rascals. Born in the 1870s in California, the brothers quickly rose to prominence during the various booms of the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addison, the elder, was a self-made architect and real-estate dealer who designed many of the fantastic homes of the fantastically rich in Palm Beach. He could &quot;age&quot; a house and its furnishings to any period his client desired--and would pay for. Wilson&#39;s adventures were even more daring and varied, and his quick wit was legendary. In addition to getting rich on the Alaskan gold rush, he had careers as a singer, playwright, prizefight promoter, con man, real-estate salesman, and shady hotel owner. Perhaps his most famous quip was one he delivered on being told that President Coolidge had died: &quot;How do they know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

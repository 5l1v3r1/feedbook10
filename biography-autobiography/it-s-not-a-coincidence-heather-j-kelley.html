  <title>It’S Not a Coincidence - Heather J. Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After receiving the call that her father had a heart attack, she hit the floor pleading with God. She would go from a skeptic of faith to learning there was a God. Her dog started the whirlwind introducing her to the spirit world. After receiving a healing, she dove into the Bible and discovered the power of prayer and the Holy Spirit. In developing her faith, she has overcome death and near-death experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;&gt;In the craziness of being a wife, mother, teacher, coach, daughter, and sister, life happens. Her love for sports led to the coaching and teaching profession where she has touched many lives. She has a bachelor of science and a masters degree in curriculum and instruction. After suffering a miscarriage and learning she did not have control over everything, she started to question who does control it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the adversity placed before her only prepared her for her biggest physical, mental and spiritual battle yet. She was helping a loved one battle Guillain-Barr and a cancer prognosis with no hope. She went from being a teacher and a coach to a full time caregiver. She learned no human has the final authority in a mans fate.  Join her on her journey of faith and what Gods Will truly is.&lt;/p&gt;" />

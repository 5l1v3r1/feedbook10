  <title>Phil a True Life Story - P.S. Kavanagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book seeks to tell a very truthful story of my own life as a boy and up to the age of 16 years old, this is only part one of a two part book, the second part tells of my life from the age of 18 to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the Author of the book and tell much of what happened in my life as a boy, some of you may find hard to believe but all can be verified, I grew up in Leeds West Yorkshire, but not all my life was here, I also spent time in London from the age of 15, until reaching the age of 16 when I went back to Leeds, I worked as an 18 year old in London on building sites at 15 year old, then moved from that to working in a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was much easier work, I worked out the rest of the year here, then went back home, on Christmas eve, 1973, however not wanted back home, I found myself living at my eldest brothers for the next few Months, then I was back on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards P.S. Kavanagh.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars - Scotty Bowers, Lionel Friedberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Newly discharged from the Marines after World War II, Scotty Bowers arrived in Hollywood in 1946. Young, charismatic, and strikingly handsome, he quickly caught the eye of many of the town&amp;#8217;s stars and starlets. He began sleeping with some himself, and connecting others with his coterie of young, attractive, and sexually free-spirited friends. His own lovers included Edith Piaf, Spencer Tracy, Vivien Leigh, Cary Grant, and the abdicated King of England Edward VIII, and he arranged tricks or otherwise crossed paths with Tennessee Williams, Charles Laughton, Vincent Price, Katharine Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, Errol Flynn, Gloria Swanson, No&amp;#235;l Coward, Mae West, James Dean, Rock Hudson and J. Edgar Hoover, to name but a few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Full Service&lt;/I&gt; is not only a fascinating chronicle of Hollywood&amp;#8217;s sexual underground, but also exposes the hypocrisy of the major studios, who used actors to propagate a myth of a conformist, sexually innocent America knowing full well that their stars&amp;#8217; personal lives differed dramatically from this family-friendly mold. As revelation-filled as &lt;I&gt;Hollywood Babylon&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Full Service&lt;/I&gt; provides a lost chapter in the history of the sexual revolution and is a testament to a man who provided sex, support, and affection to countless people.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Wisdom From The Heart - Wael Elhalwani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Success, power, a multi-million dollar company, adoring fans&amp;mdash;and all at the ripe,&lt;br /&gt;
young age of 36? Most would consider this hitting the jackpot, but for Wael Elhalwani,&lt;br /&gt;
the founder and CEO of Starbuzz Tobacco, it was anything but. The truth is that it&lt;br /&gt;
took years of hard work&amp;mdash;and then some&amp;mdash;before his dreams came true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people know the struggle that Wael endured in order to climb his way to the top.&lt;br /&gt;
And few people know that his success is about more than numbers or earnings. The&lt;br /&gt;
reason why Wael has been able to not only surpass competition, but set the bar higher&lt;br /&gt;
with each success, is because he works to better himself as well as the lives of those&lt;br /&gt;
around him. And that&amp;rsquo;s something you don&amp;rsquo;t hear about these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for any other dreamer out there, whether it&amp;rsquo;s you, your child, your friend,&lt;br /&gt;
or a family member. Wael Elhalwani is living proof that when your heart and mind are&lt;br /&gt;
in the right place, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Good Old Days - Harold Flagg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1999, I flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL, to Japan for
$28.39 round-trip. Previously, a round-trip from Fort Lauderdale
to Turkey cost me $17 and change. On the Turkish flight, a
computer glitch wiped out my documentation shortly after I landed
in Frankfurt, Germany. To compensate, Delta Air Lines upgraded
me to BusinessElite class, featuring free champagne and choice
of filet mignon or salmon steak served on a cozy table set with
sparkling crystal and the finest silver and china. Most of my
caviar lifestyle on a tuna budget has been based on United States
Social Security and Bahamas National Insurance payments, having
worked many years in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.
Whats the catch? Basically, it was playing the discount-fare
and frequent-flier game to the Nth degree, N as in nothing, in
many cases. My best free junkets in senior-friendly skies came
via Delta Air Lines frequent flier mileage. My Delta SkyMiles
were tallied by such senior-citizen bargains as a Fort Lauderdale-
Hawaii round-trip ticket for as little as $440. That alone
added some 10,000 FF miles to my account.
Signing for a Delta SkyMiles credit card netted 10,000 miles;
a switch to MCI telephone service scored another 5,000 or so.
An MCI WorldCom/SkyMiles long-distance card is good for five
10 HAROLD FLAGG
miles per dollar spent. There is at least one case where a motormouth
literally talked his way into a free trip!
Investors can rack up major mileage via Delta" />

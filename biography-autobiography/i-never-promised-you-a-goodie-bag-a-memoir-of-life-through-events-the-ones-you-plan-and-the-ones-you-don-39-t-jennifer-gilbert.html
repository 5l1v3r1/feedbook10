  <title>I Never Promised You a Goodie Bag: A Memoir of Life Through Events, the Ones You Plan and the Ones You Don&#39;t - Jennifer Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A warm, wise, and wholly original memoir of survival, renewal, and transformation, by one of New York City&amp;#8217;s most successful and respected special events coordinators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her top-level events company, Save the Date, Jennifer Gilbert has worked with Fortune 500 companies, broadcast media giants, international nonprofit organizations, and celebrities from Oprah Winfrey to Bill Gates and beyond. Yet few of her clients or colleagues have known, until now, that Jennifer not only a self-made success: she&amp;#8217;s also a survivor. After a random, near-fatal attack left her body in critical condition on a crowded city street, and left her with emotional wounds that would take years to heal, Jennifer embarked upon a journey to reclaim her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is her story, in her own words:&lt;em&gt; I Never Promised You a Goodie Bag&lt;/em&gt;, an intimate, poignant, inspiring memoir of perseverance, rediscovery, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>A Gay Epiphany - Robert K. Pavlick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Gay Epiphany is basically my autobiography, the autobiography of a man of no importance, but it is really much more than that. It covers a 55 year journey beginning with an innocent young childs search for God, complicated by the conflicting dogmas and interpretations of institutional Christianity and coupled with growing up gay in the 1950s and 60s.
The book covers the struggles of a young man who wants only to serve God, but who meets with nothing but religious hostility and condemnation from institutional Christianity due to his homosexuality. It addresses many areas of study including comparative religion, Eastern philosophy, New Age, The Christian Right, politics, The American Dream, fundamentalism, misinterpretation of religious texts, authenticity of the Bible itself and many other related topics quoting from specialists in those fields of study.
It is an appeal to religious leaders, parents, educators and legislators to show more compassion towards gay men and women and grant them the full respect and equality to which they are entitled under a secular democracy. It is my gift to my gay brothers and sisters who may still be struggling with how to integrate their sexual identity with their spirituality. It is also intended as my gift to those in the heterosexual community who still may be struggling with which spiritual path, out of the hundreds that exist, would be most advantageous to their spiritual growth. One can either choose a path which believes that the glass is half empty or a path which believes that the glass is half full." />

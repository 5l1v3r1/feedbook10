      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CREATE YOUR OWN FUTURE: How to Master the 12 Critical Factors of Unlimited Success” by Brian Tracy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian Tracy is chairman and CEO of his own consulting and training organization, Brian Tracy International. He is also one of the world’s most successful public speakers addressing about 450,000 people in the United States and 25 other countries every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Success in life and business is not the result of a random process or the subject of chance. Instead, success is highly predictable. As Brian Tracy explains in Create your Own Future, the journey to long-term success can readily be broken down into twelve critical factors or principles. Follow the same path and the proven processes others have followed and you must ultimately end up in the same place they did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice, the achievement of long-term success relies on how well these twelve principles are applied in your own life. According to the author, by understanding these principles and taking actions that are in harmony, you improve your likelihood of success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a simple and straightforward style, Brian Tracy reveals how to create your own future based on decisions you are making today. A must read for all achievers." />

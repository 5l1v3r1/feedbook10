  <title>Comedy Sex God - Pete Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part autobiography, part philosophical inquiry, and part spiritual quest, &lt;em&gt;Comedy Sex God&lt;/em&gt; is a hilarious, profound, and enlightening romp around the fertile mind of stand-up stand-out, podcast king, and HBO superstar Pete Holmes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Holmes is a sold-out-every-night stand-up comedian with two HBO specials and the host of the hugely successful podcast &lt;em&gt;You Made It Weird&lt;/em&gt;, and he was the creator-star of the hit HBO show &lt;em&gt;Crashing&lt;/em&gt;. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t always roses for Pete. Growing up, Pete was raised an evangelical Christian, but his religion taught him that being &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;smoking, drinking, having doubts or premarital sex&amp;#8212;would get him sent to an eternity in hell. So, terrified of the God he loved, Pete devoted his life to being &amp;#8220;good,&amp;#8221; even marrying his first girlfriend at the age of twenty-two only to discover a few years later he was being cheated on. Thanks for nothing, God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete&amp;#8217;s failed attempt at a picture-perfect life forced him to reexamine his beliefs, but neither atheism, nor Christianity, nor copious bottles of Yellow Tail led him to enlightenment. Pete longed for a model of faith that served him and his newfound uncertainties about the universe, so he embarked on a soul-seeking journey that continues to this day. Through encounters with mind-altering substances, honing his craft in front of thousands of his comedy fans, and spending time with savants like Ram Dass, Pete forged a new life&amp;#8212;both spiritually and personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written and often completely hilarious&amp;#8212;imagine Dass&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Be Here No&lt;/em&gt;w if penned by one of the funniest people alive&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Comedy Sex God &lt;/em&gt;reveals a man at the top of his game and a seeker in search of the deeper meanings of life, love, and comedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />

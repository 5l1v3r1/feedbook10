  <title>Condi - Mary Beth Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;One day I&#39;ll be in that house,&quot; said ten year old Condoleezza Rice as she gazed across the White House&#39;s expansive front lawn.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Of course, Condi made good on that promise. With poise and gracefulness?combined with an iron will and determination?rarely seen in Washington, Rice has become one of the most iconic and influential figures on the world stage. This is her story.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Condi&lt;/I&gt; provides an in-depth study of the life, faith, and achievements of one of America&#39;s most fascinating women. From her humble beginnings in segregated Alabama to her academic career, from her first days in Washington to her appointment as Secretary of State and beyond, &lt;I&gt;Condi&lt;/I&gt; investigates Rice&#39;s rise to political prominence. Drawing from in-depth research, Mary Beth Brown explores how Condi&#39;s parents, mentors, faith, and defining moments have helped her grow into a position of power and global influence.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Here is a story of inspiration, of principle, and of the limitless opportunities for those who pursue their dreams with unfailing hope and dogged determination.&lt;/P&gt;" />

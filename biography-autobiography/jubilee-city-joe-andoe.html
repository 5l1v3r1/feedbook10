  <title>Jubilee City - Joe Andoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joe Andoe is an internationally exhibited painter. His work, hailed by &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; as &quot;cowboy noir with a fashionista twist,&quot; is in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Whitney Museum of Art in New York, and countless other locations. He is a father. He is a writer. He is sober. That&#39;s now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, though, way back in the &#39;70s, Joe Andoe was a delinquent bad boy growing up wild in Tulsa, Oklahoma&amp;#8212;drinking, drugging, and driving too fast down a dead-end road. He was one car crash, one overdose away from head-on disaster. His art saved him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life story told in discrete, arresting snapshots of despair, resilience, creativity, and hope, Joe Andoe&#39;s raw, vivid, and utterly original memoir is as striking as his painting. With echoes of Jim Carroll poetic insight and Charles Bukowski grit, yet still uniquely the artist&#39;s own, Andoe&#39;s literary portrait of his time to date on earth is as powerful as a heavyweight&#39;s hook and as spellbinding as a major crack-up on the opposite side of the highway. It is an important work of curiosity and grandiosity; a testament to a young man&#39;s resilience and genius and luck that enabled him to survive a life lived wildly out of control; an unparalleled adventure, a rocket ride from the sordid depths of self-destruction to the glorious pinnacles of&amp;#8230;Jubilee City&lt;/p&gt;" />

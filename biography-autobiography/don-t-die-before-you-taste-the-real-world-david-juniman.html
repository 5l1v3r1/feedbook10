  <title>Don’T Die Before You Taste the Real World - David Juniman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For most of my schoolmates, that was a  dreadful day. At fi rst I thought it was not all that good of a day for me either, but as the day progressed, by the afternoon I realized that it was one of my superior days.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At school there was to be an exambut not an ordinary exam. This one was to determine if we would be graduating from the middle school and next year attend high school, or if we would fail and next year repeat the same class. The format of the exam was prepared to be most intimidating. The exam was taking place orally!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The students were intimidated, indeed were horrifi ed with this new exam style... Seeing so many students scared that deeply around me was multiplying my anxiety unbearably. My mind was racing with so many what if&#39;s that as soon as I could try to come up with one rational answer for one of these, the mind was coming up with ten more of them.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I was next in line, but not yet called. Suddenly something that never happened to me before happened... &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A feeling of well-being and peacefulness engulfed me. It felt like my mind was not able to deal with the chaos of the day, and that was the reason for the anxiety. Apparently now another capacity within me took over. As soon as it did, there remained no need for fear. This new boss would always know what to do in every situation.&lt;/P&gt;" />

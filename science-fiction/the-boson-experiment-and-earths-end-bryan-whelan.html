  <title>The Boson Experiment and Earths End - Bryan Whelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here are two more stories about earths future. One is in the near future and the other as far in the future as Earth can get.
The Boson Experiment was the brainchild of Abby McGovern, who was trying to create an artificial black hole. Her world was turned upside down when she met someone who was her direct opposite, a ghost hunter. The two never imagined that they would both eventually be chasing the same thing.
In Earths End, the Earth is about to be swallowed up by the now-expanding sun. Only three religions still survived, and science was one of them. The two religions, Christianity and Islam, accepted that this was the end of the human race and readied themselves to meet their makers. Science instead proposed leaving Earth and traveling to a distant planet as the last hope for humanity. Just how will they survive the journey for so many years? Will the human race live long enough to reach this new world?" />

Mandi Monkey is the cutest monkey in all of the animal kingdom. And Mashy? She is not so cute. In fact she is at the opposite end of the scale and green with envy. One day she leads Mandi away from her mother and ties her to a tree outside a leopard&#39;s den. What will happen to poor Mandi?  Caya is a crocodile who cannot bring herself to eat meat and she knows that she won&#39;t live very long this way. She meets a little bird who promises to find a cure if she promises him her hand in marriage. Can Caya trust this little bird to be true to his word? And will she keep her promise to him?   Hyena rescues a trio of lost warthogs and has to overcome his instincts not to gobble them up. He takes them on a trek through the bush in search of their mother. All are suspicious of his motives. Will the warthogs be reunited with their mother?  9400 words" />

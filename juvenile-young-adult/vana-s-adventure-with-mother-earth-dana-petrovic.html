  <title>Vana’S Adventure with Mother Earth - Dana Petrovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vana is a curious girl who loves her visits to her grandmothers farm because there is always so much to discover. One spring afternoon, she boldly ventures to a part of her grannys orchard she hasnt yet explored and discovers, to her joy, falling white fruit blossoms evoking images of freshly fallen snow. After lying down to feel the petals caress her face, she is surprisingly approached by Mother Earth who invites the young Vana to accompany her on a soon-to-be remarkable journey to meet some of her most cherished children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Vana joins Mother Earth on an incredible adventure that she could have never accomplished on her own. The adventure takes her to far-off places, and she meets those whom will become lifelong friends. This adventure can utterly change your view on the relationships you have with all other living species with whom you share home here on our Earth, as it did for Vana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this story was initially composed for children, upon reflection it should also be as enjoyable and valuable for those much older, for it ought to address the inner child within all of us.&lt;/p&gt;" />

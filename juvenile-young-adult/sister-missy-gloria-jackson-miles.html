  <title>Sister Missy - Gloria Jackson Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sister Missy is a fictitious story about three wealthy sisters who are triplets. They look differently, they dress differently, and they have different personalities.
Sister Missy is the oldest of the three. She is aggressive and funny. Isabella, the second oldest; she speaks whatever comes to her mind. Isadore is the youngest; she is a little shy at times.
They have never been married, but were engaged at one time or the other. They enjoy being single. Sister Missy said being single is so peaceful and you dont have any worries.
All of them have hobbies that they enjoy. Isabella and Isadore make quilts. They own the largest quilt factory in South Carolina. And they have a quilt shop beside it. People come from all over the world to buy them.
Sister Missy takes care of cats every day. She has ten cats. Six are girls and four are boys. She got them, from an auction when they were six weeks old. She takes them to be part of her family.
The sisters live in a twenty-two room white, four story brick mansion. It is in the suburbs of Chester County, South Carolina in a town called Little Swan South Carolina. Only the rich and wealthy can live there.
All of them drive Cadillac convertibles. Sister Missys Cadillac was custom made especially for her, and it is red.
They are elderly at 81 years of age. But they dont like to be around old people. Sister Missy said they talk too much and they tell everything. They dont know how to keep a secret.
They had big celebration for their 82nd birthday. And they invited 200 guests. Everyone in the family will enjoy Sister Missy." />

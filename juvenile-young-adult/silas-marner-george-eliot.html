  <title>Silas Marner - George Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe is the third novel by George Eliot, published in 1861. An outwardly simple tale of a linen weaver, it is notable for its strong realism and its sophisticated treatment of a variety of issues ranging from religion to industrialisation to community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a small Calvinist congregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street in Northern England. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation&amp;#39;s funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two clues are given against Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery in his own house of the bag formerly containing the money. There is the strong suggestion that Silas&amp;#39; best friend, William Dane, has framed him, since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Lots are drawn in the belief - shared by Silas - that God will direct the process and establish the truth. However Silas is proclaimed guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and instead marries William. With his life shattered, his trust in God lost and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city for a rural area where he is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marner travels south to the Midlands and settles near the rural village of Raveloe in Warwickshire, where he lives isolated and alone, choosing to have only minimam(least;only for his weaving work as Raveloe womens need him in weaving as he is a linen weaver) contact with the residents. He throws himself into his craft and comes to adore the gold coins he earns and hoards from his weaving.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One foggy night, the two bags of gold are stolen by Dunstan (&amp;quot;Dunsey&amp;quot;) Cass, a dissolute younger son of Squire Cass, the town&amp;#39;s leading landowner. Silas then sinks into a deep gloom, despite the villagers&amp;#39; attempts to aid him. Dunsey immediately disappears, but little is made of this by the community because he had vanished several times before.&lt;br /&gt;

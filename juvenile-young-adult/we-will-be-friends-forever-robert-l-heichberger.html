  <title>We Will Be Friends Forever - Robert L. Heichberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story was inspired by the authors two granddaughters and is based upon a true event. One evening, the two young granddaughters were in their yard at their home in South Carolina. It was already dusk, but the full moon was giving light to the yard. The girls could not believe what they saw coming down their long tree-lined driveway. To their amazement, they could see a very young paint-colored pony sauntering in their yard. Both girls, aged nine and twelve, were delighted with what they saw. They were so excited they just could not believe their eyes. You see, the girls love horses and all that nature provides.
This story depicts the bond of friendship that can be developed between the pony and the young girls. The story shows how friendships can develop in all forms and at any age between people and their fondness for animals. Clearly, the story of We Will Be Friends Forever demonstrates that friendships can be developed when a friendly hand is extended. Both young and old will love this touching story as to how friendships are built with a bond of trust and kindness. To all our readers, enjoy!" />

  <title>Freak Magnet - Andrew Auseon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel about freaks, geeks, crushes, and friends&amp;#8212;and how sometimes you can be all of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie is the freak. Gloria is the freak magnet. They&#39;re pretty much destined to meet. And when they do, sparks fly . . . for Charlie. Gloria, well, she just thinks he&#39;s like every other freak who feels compelled to talk to her, although a little better-looking than most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Charlie has his head in the clouds, Gloria&#39;s got hers in a book: her Freak Folio&amp;#8212;a record of every weirdo who&#39;s talked to her in the last year (it&#39;s a big book). But never before has she felt the pull to get to know one of them better. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this he-said-she-said tale of love, loss, and lucky signs from the author of the ac-claimed &lt;em&gt;Funny Little Monkey&lt;/em&gt;, two young strangers at a crossroads in their lives become friends by happy accident (okay, maybe some harmless stalking is involved&amp;#8212;and not by the person you&#39;d think!) and forever change each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />

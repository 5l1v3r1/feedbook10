  <title>Night Star - Alyson Noël</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After fighting for centuries to be together, Immortals Ever and Damen&#39;s future hinges on one final showdown that will leave readers gasping for breath.  Don&#39;t miss &lt;/i&gt;Night Star--&lt;i&gt; the explosive new installment of Alyson Noel&#39;s #1 bestselling &lt;/i&gt;Immortals &lt;i&gt;series that&#39;s enchanted millions across the world!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haven still blames Ever for the death of her boyfriend Roman, no matter how hard Ever&#39;s tried to convince her it was an accident.  Now she&#39;s determined to take Ever down...and destroy Damen and Jude along the way.  Her first step is to tear Ever and Damen apart--and she has just the ammunition to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hidden in one of Ever&#39;s past lives is a terrible secret about Damen--a secret that illuminates new facts about her relationship with Jude, but that&#39;s so dark and brutal it might be enough to drive her and Damen apart once and for all.  As Ever faces her greatest fears about the guy she wants to spend eternity with, she&#39;s thrust into a deadly clash with Haven that could destroy them all.&lt;br&gt;Now it&#39;ll take everything she&#39;s got--and bring out powers she never knew she had--to face down her most formidable enemy.  But in order to win, she must first ask herself: is her own survival worth dooming Haven to an eternity of darkness in the Shadowland?  And will learning the truth about Damen&#39;s past hold the key to their future?&lt;/p&gt;" />

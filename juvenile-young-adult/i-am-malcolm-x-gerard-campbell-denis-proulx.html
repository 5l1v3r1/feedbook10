  <title>I Am Malcolm X - Gerard Campbell, Denis Proulx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote a play and needed it edited.So, not knowing what to do, I went online and contacted Susan Austin at American Association of Community Theatre (AACT). Ms Austin was more than polite and told me she knew of someone who might read over my material. Thinking, hmm, I wrote a play, imagine my shock when I was advised,  I not only didnt have a play written I should go to school to learn writing. Forward I went, enrolling in an English composition course @ Atlantic City Community College, Professor, Nina Washington. In spite of my delusion I learned.
		When the course was complete I wrote I am Malcolm X for the professor as a token of thanks and appreciation. That was that, as they say. Well, two months later I was reading the preface of The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykl and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. Mr. Stevensons wife, while editing his prose, notated that he was writing an allegory, not a narrative. I didnt know what allegory meant so I researched the word and lo and behold for the first time in my life I sawPlatos Allegory of the Cave. Needless to say, by doing as AACT suggested,  I accidently mimicked Plato with a story about a man I feel would have united the black community and perhaps others had he been able to relate what he found in the light.

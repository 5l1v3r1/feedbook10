      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sequel to &lt;i&gt;Losers, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; You&#39;re a Brave Man, Julius Zimmerman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As seventh grade begins, Lizzie Archer knows she can&#39;t endure another year of being derided as the class nerd. Maybe she can&#39;t stop being smart -- does she want to? -- but at least she doesn&#39;t have to look so different. Out of her Emily Dickinson dresses and into Gap jeans she goes, and the effect is amazing. The girls talk to her; the boys tease her. But her braininess remains an obstacle to her popularity, and Lizzie wants so to be liked, especially by Ethan Winfield. To her teacher&#39;s amazement, Lizzie begins to make mistakes in math. Ethan is horrified -- he&#39;s her math partner -- but no one is more unhappy, or confused, than Lizzie. Will she ever find herself? Through her sparkling Lizzie Archer, Claudia Mills extends a hand to girls, gently encouraging them to be all that they can and to feel confident that like will befriend like.&lt;/p&gt;" />

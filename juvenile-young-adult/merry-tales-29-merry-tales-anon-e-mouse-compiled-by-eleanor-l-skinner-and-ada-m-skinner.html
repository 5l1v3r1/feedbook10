  <title>MERRY TALES - 29 Merry Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Eleanor L Skinner and Ada M Skinner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Education is meant to be an enlightening experience. In order to inspire and enlighten children, they must be given bright and inspirational stories to read. They will find them in &lt;i&gt;Merry Tales&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are 29 stories chosen by two school teachers, first, because they are stories children have always loved, and second, because they are free from much of the gruesome and grotesque which figures in so many of the early folk tales and fables of the past.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Monkey and the Crocodile &amp;ndash; from Jataka Tales,&lt;br /&gt;
The Hillman and the Housewife - Juliana H. Ewing&lt;br /&gt;
The Forest Bailiff &amp;ndash; A Russian Legend&lt;br /&gt;
Bruin and Reynard Partners &amp;ndash; A Scandinavian Folk Tale&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Wishes &amp;ndash; A Swedish Legend&lt;br /&gt;
The Stone Lion &amp;ndash; by Captain W. P. O&amp;rsquo;Connor; and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
They are accompanied by 12 colour plates and good many BnW vignettes which, together, bring life, and interest, to the tales.&lt;br /&gt;
This book is intended as a supplementary reader for children in their third or fourth year of school and the vocabulary has been carefully graded to meet that need. The stories are in essence short, but long enough to keep a young mind interested without becoming bored. Some of the stories have dramatic qualities and will be found to lend themselves readily to dramatisation.&lt;br /&gt;
Early in life children should learn something of myths and folklore. These tales are founded on these old treasures, but are charmingly adapted to the understanding of present-day children.&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to download and read this book of Merry Tales.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;

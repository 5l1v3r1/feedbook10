  <title>Elijah and the Elephant - Sheila Riedl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elijah and the Elephant is a dream I had one night.  It was a fun movie my mind played as I was sleeping.  When I woke up the next morning, I could not stop thinking about the dream.  I had prayed the night before for God to give me a new project to work on.  I decided writing this book must be the project.  I began to write down as much of the dream as I could remember.  When my kids asked me what I was doing, I told them.  They asked me to tell them the story.  They liked it and wanted me to finish the story.  My husband and kids encouraged me to turn the story into a book to share with others.  I hope others will enjoy this fun story.  It is a story about a adventurous young girl, friendship, and helping others." />

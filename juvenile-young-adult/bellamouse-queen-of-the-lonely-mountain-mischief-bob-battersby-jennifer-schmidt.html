  <title>Bellamouse—Queen of the Lonely Mountain Mischief - Bob Battersby, Jennifer Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Queen Bellamouse and King Stumplemouse and their large and happy mischief face a dismal future with just a few morsels left for food. After dismissing members of their nest because they cannot provide for them, Bellamouse and Stumplemouse huddle together behind a cabinet in the cabin they call home and wait for their fate. But just then, the cabin shakes with the thump of footsteps. Everything is about to change for the two frightened mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the musty silence is filled with human voices and the aroma of raisins, nuts, and cheese, Bellamouse and Stumplemouse quietly dance in celebration, for they know they are about to be saved by food, glorious food. But what they do not know is that the hermit who occupies the cabin has decided that being alone is not so great after all. When he tempts Bellamouse with a bit of peanut butter, befriends the mice, and names them Mildred and Stump, all three discover an unlikely friendship that provides them with more than they ever imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful childrens tale, two hungry mice and a lonely hermit form a little community where they all learn the true meaning of family and the joy of caring for others.&lt;/p&gt;" />

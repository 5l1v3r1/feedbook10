  <title>Sam Iver - Alexander McNeece</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teased at school and ignored at home, unpopular sixteen-year-old Sam Iver feels utterly alone. That is, until he logs onto the Internet to play video games against people from all over the world. 
	Using the alias Henry Ruff, Sam becomes one of the most feared players in a game called Imminent Threat. This fast-paced, true-to-life tactical battle is Henry Ruffs digital playground, where the winners have elite skills and reflexes. Sam is on his way to becoming the best player ever, but his video game world soon translates to the real world. Jun Sung, one of his online playing partners known as Jade, is kidnapped from her home in Chicago because of her fathers past affiliation with the tightly controlled North Korean nuclear program. 
	When Sam spots Jun at the worlds largest computer gaming tournament at a Chicago hotel, the two teens are thrust into the middle of an international incident. Their survival hinges on Sams decision-making abilities. Will he make the right choices when it could be the difference between life and death?  
	Filled with problem solving and life lessons; Sam Iver: Imminent Threat follows a talented young gamer who must use his world-class gaming skills to save the life of a fellow player." />

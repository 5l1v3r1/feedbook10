  <title>Quest for the Nautilus: Young Captain Nemo - Jason Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Armed with his wits, his friends, and his Nemotech submarine, a twelve-year-old descendant of Jules Verne&#39;s famous antihero must race against the clock to save his kidnapped mother in &lt;i&gt;Quest for the Nautilus: Young Captain Nemo&lt;/i&gt;, the second installment in Jason Henderson&#39;s action-packed middle grade series...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel Nemo has never been your normal, everyday twelve-year-old. As a descendant of the famous Captain Nemo, he&#39;s determined to use his Nemotech legacy for good. He and his best friends Peter and Misty spend their days studying at the elite Nemo Institute and in their spare time, run rescue missions in Gabriel&#39;s submarine &lt;i&gt;The Obscure&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a mysterious organization using advanced technology attacks the Institute and kidnaps Gabriel&#39;s mother, he and his friends set off on a race against the clock.

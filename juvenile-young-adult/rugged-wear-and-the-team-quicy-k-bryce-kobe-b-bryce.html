He knows the meaning of friendship and the importance of having friends. 
This day cannot be the best if you are not with someone that you, Peacock, and the Team can call on. 
What matters is that you and the Team are about to stand for something. We are somebody special. We are behind the hill and down under for each other. Its never about money at all. You wont hear a thing about money!
We have learned how to have a good time, and it is all fun and games!
It is about music, dancing, singing, and somewhere that we are always having fun!" />

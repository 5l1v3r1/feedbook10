  <title>The Magnificent 12: The Call - Michael Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Mack MacAvoy suffers from a serious case of mediumness. Medium looks. Medium grades. Medium parents who barely notice him. With a list of phobias that could make anyone crazy, Mack never would have guessed that he is destined for a more-than-medium life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, one day, something incredibly strange happens to Mack. A three-thousand-year-old man named Grimluk appears in the boys&amp;#8217; bathroom to deliver some startling news: Mack is one of the Magnificent Twelve, called the Magnifica in ancient times, whatever that means. An evil force is on its way, and it&amp;#8217;s up to Mack to track down eleven other twelve-year-olds in order to stop it. He must travel across the world to battle the wicked Pale Queen&amp;#8217;s dangerous daughter, Ereskigal&amp;#8212;also known as Risky. But Risky sounds a little scary, and Mack doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be a hero. Will he answer the call?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A laugh-out-loud story filled with excitement and magic, &lt;em&gt;The Magnificent Twelve: The Call&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in bestselling author Michael Grant&amp;#8217;s hilarious new fantasy adventure series.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>William Bee&#39;s Wonderful World of Trucks - William Bee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Bee loves his trucks. He has lots, and if you&#39;re lucky he&#39;ll show you some of them and tell you all about them. There&#39;s his tanker truck, which carries all the fuel he needs for his vehicles - in fact it holds enough fuel for 650 cars! Then there&#39;s his coal-fired steam truck, his amphibious truck, which can swim, his truck with its very own crane and his snow-blowing truck, plus the truck that carries all of his racing cars, and not forgetting his jet-powered truck that can reach 370mph! And that&#39;s just the beginning of his collection.
Join William, his dog and his gang of unruly traffic cones on a grand tour of the world of trucks. Perfect for every child who is fascinated by vehicles large and small - but mainly large!

  <title>Dr. Critchlore&amp;#39;s School for Minions (#1) - Sheila Grau, Joe Sutphin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Welcome to Dr. Critchlore&amp;rsquo;s School for Minions, the premier trainer of minions for Evil Overlords everywhere. No student is prouder to be at Dr. Critchlore&amp;rsquo;s than Runt Higgins, a twelve-year-old werewolf. (At least he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s twelve. He was abandoned at the school as a baby, so he can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure.) Runt loves everything about Dr. Critchlore&amp;rsquo;s. He loves his classes&amp;mdash;such as History of Henchmen and Introduction to Explosives. He loves his friends&amp;mdash;such as Darthin the gargoyle and Syke the tree nymph. And he loves his foster family, who took him in when his wolf pack couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;But not everyone loves Dr. Critchlore&amp;rsquo;s as much as Runt. After a series of disasters, each worse than the next, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that someone is trying to shut the school down. It&amp;rsquo;s up to Runt, who knows the place better than anybody, to figure out who&amp;rsquo;s behind the attacks . . . and to save his home, and Dr. Critchlore himself, from total destruction.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;" />

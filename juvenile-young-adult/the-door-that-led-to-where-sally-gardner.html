  <title>The Door That Led to Where - Sally Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the present offers no hope for the future, the answers may lie in the past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AJ Flynn has just failed all but one of his GCSEs, and his future is looking far from rosy. So when he is offered a junior position at a London law firm he hopes his life is about to change - but he could never have imagined by how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Tidying up the archive one day, AJ finds an old key, mysteriously labelled with his name and date of birth - and he becomes determined to find the door that fits the key. And so begins an amazing journey to a very real and tangible past - 1830, to be precise - where the streets of modern Clerkenwell are replaced with cobbles and carts, and the law can be twisted to suit a villain&#39;s means. Although life in 1830 is cheap, AJ and his friends quickly find that their own lives have much more value. They&#39;ve gone from sad youth statistics to young men with purpose - and at the heart of everything lies a crime that only they can solve. But with enemies all around, can they unravel the mysteries of the past, before it unravels them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  A fast-paced mystery novel by one of the country&#39;s finest writers, THE DOOR THAT LED TO WHERE will delight, surprise and mesmerise all those who read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Random - Adam Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author of &#39;Better Out Than In&#39; and &#39;Better Out Than In Number Twos&#39; is back with a collection of random musings and drawings that will make kids laugh out loud. It includes Adam&#39;s wacky view of topics including &#39;Top 5 Dance Moves&#39;, &#39;Top 5 Super Powers&#39; and &#39;Things That Look Cute But Will Scratch Your Eyes Out If You Try To Hug Them&#39;. There&#39;s even a recipe for Roast Monkey Butt with Tofu and Apples (No monkeys were harmed in the making of this book though!).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s random, it&#39;s weird and it&#39;s definitely hilarious! As Adam says, &amp;quot;Look, to be honest, it was just me rambling on about anything that popped into my head, and now there is a whole book of this random stuff! A WHOLE BOOK! THIS BOOK! OMG! Which means Oh My God. It doesn&#39;t mean, as I initially thought, Old Men Giggled. And LOL doesn&#39;t mean Lots Of Love! I found that out when someone died and I wrote to their wife and said, &#39;I hear that your husband died. I&#39;m sorry. LOL.&#39; It didn&#39;t go down too well.&amp;quot;" />

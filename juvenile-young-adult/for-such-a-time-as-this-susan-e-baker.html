  <title>For Such a Time as This - Susan E. Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mannie is an unpredictable, determined, twelve-year old girl with a large imagination and lots of questions. Her own self-doubt is fueled by wondering why God made her ears stick out? Why Jamey, a fun and likeable 6th grade boy, chooses Mannie to be his best buddy? Why Cynthia Colbert, the most popular girl in school, keeps pestering and making fun of her in front of Mannies classmates? Why does her homeroom teacher never smile at Mannie? Biggest question of all? What is going on behind the doors of the old Benson Mansion? &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Through prayers Mannie begins to realize that she is fearful of a lot of things. This awakening prompts her to do something about this feeling of dread she faces every day. Mannie searching for answers to her dilemma discovers how much her Father in heaven loves her, and with her parents loving guidance they begin to read the story of Esther together from the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mannie still wondering about her abilities begins to gradually take steps of faith each day and see God at work in her life. Taking the chip off of her shoulder she begins to lose fear as her companion and replaces fear with strength, self-discipline, and kindness. Mannie realizes to embrace those ears she felt were unreasonably silly and out of control as a gift from God not a curse. Meanwhile, Mannie and Jamey take a journey together to solve the mystery of the old Benson Mansion. The answer to the noises and happenings will leave the reader feeling just as surprised as Mannie and Jamey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun packed adventure with struggles, intrigue, and a touch of mystery. Find out how Mannie does work through her difficult circumstances with Esther as her new mentor. Mannie starts to live her faith and begins to understand that this is her time in the 21st century, in her school, with her classmates, with Jamey, for . . . such a time as this.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Camp Princess 1: Born to Rule - Kathryn Lasky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Camp Princess is just like any other summer camp. Okay, so it&#39;s not exactly summer, since the magical kingdom of Palacyndra has seasons that change at the drop of a tiara. And it&#39;s not exactly camp, since the princesses stay in fully furnished turrets, complete with chambermaids. But it is a chance to get away from home and enjoy activities such as arts and crafts (with diamonds, of course) and moat swimming (bathing tiara required!). It&#39;s a place where Princess Alicia makes real friends, Princesses Kristen and Gunder-snap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Alicia, Camp Princess becomes much more. A place of mystery. Her turret seems to be haunted, and the golden bird that she captured for the songbird contest refuses to sing a note! It&#39;s all utterly frustrating -- until one shadowy night, when Alicia feels a ghostly presence in her room and begins to discover a destiny far more exciting than anything she could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Josh Cody - R.A. Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jack Richards, a sports journalist with The Telegraph discovered 15 year old Josh Cody in a street brawl in 2006, he could not have foreseen the life changing, and often dangerous adventures that lay ahead.
As a sceptic of modern youth he was no pushover when it came to recognising Josh’s potential as a boxer, but such were his talents that it required little or no imagination to be convinced of his potential.
In 2004 Josh’s mother was kidnapped on the same day that his father, a sergeant in the SAS, had been reported missing, believed killed in Baghdad.
After going to the USA Josh is involved in the rescue of a young African-American girl and, following this, becomes world famous after appearing on the David Letterman TV chat show.
This is the story of Josh’s search for the truth about his parents." />

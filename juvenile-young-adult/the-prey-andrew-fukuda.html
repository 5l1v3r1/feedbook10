  <title>The Prey - Andrew Fukuda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Action-packed, heart-pounding, page-flipping action.  I&#39;m thoroughly in love with this riveting, thrilling read. -YA Reads&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&#39;t miss the electrifying second book in the must-read trilogy of the year!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With death only a heartbeat away, Gene and the remaining humans must find a way to survive long enough to escape the hungry predators chasing them through the night.  But they&#39;re not the only things following Gene.  He&#39;s haunted by Ashley June who he left behind, and his burgeoning feelings for Sissy, the human girl at his side.&lt;br&gt;Their escape takes them to a refuge of humans living high in the mountains.  Gene and his friends think they&#39;re finally safe, but not everything here is as it seems.  And before long, Gene must ask himself if the new world they&#39;ve entered is just as evil as the one they left behind.  As their enemies close in on them and push Gene and Sissy closer, one thing becomes painfully clear: all they have is each other...if they can stay alive.&lt;br&gt;Chilling, inventive, and electrifying, &lt;i&gt;The Prey &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in Andrew Fukuda&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Hunt &lt;/i&gt;series.&lt;/p&gt;" />

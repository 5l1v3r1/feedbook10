  <title>It&#39;s Up There - Larry  er</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s Up There is a rare story about love and courage. This lively but child-friendly thriller begins with an innovative little boy named Adrian, who conjures up a fantasy about avoiding afternoon naps. A vivid imagination, mythical characters, and unforeseen events force him into a scary scenario. Adrian overcomes a terrifying experience and his fear of the dark by finding the courage to save his mother from a horrible, hairy, fictitious creature, which he mistakenly believes has captured her in the attic. Adrian&#39;s story weaves in and out of whimsical subplots connecting the fabric of each anecdote, while highlighting themes that are constant in a child&#39;s life. The plot is based on a real event involving childhood mystery and adventure, as well as overcoming a common fear. There is also humor, fantasy, and the achievement of a heart-warming age-specific milestone. It&#39;s Up There adds up to a rich tapestry of positive reinforcement that can help a child to creatively find the courage to do the right thing." />

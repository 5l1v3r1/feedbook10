  <title>Velvet Learns a Lesson - Veonne Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Velvet is a naughty puppy who doesnt like to obey her mother. Sometimes this gets her into trouble. Its especially difficult to behave when Velvets nose is filled with the most delicious scent shes ever smelled. Velvet hears her mother calling her as she trots away toward the delicious aroma. But for Velvet, a mothers scolding is far easier to ignore than a yummy scent.
Velvets twitching nose leads her to a cozy cottage, where she finds three freshly baked sugar cookies laid nicely on a plate labeled For Santa. Before she knows it, Velvet has gobbled up one of the sugar cookies. As she turns to leave, Velvet finds herself nose-to-boot with a familiar man dressed all in red. Its Santa Clausand he doesnt look happy with what he sees.
Velvet Learns a Lesson offers parents a magical opportunity to demonstrate the importance of obedience to young children. Remind your young ones that Santas always watching with Velvets whimsical adventure to the North Pole and back." />

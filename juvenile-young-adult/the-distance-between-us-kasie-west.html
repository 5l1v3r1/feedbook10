  <title>The Distance Between Us - Kasie West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Money can&#39;t buy a good first impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Caymen Meyers learned early that the rich are not to be trusted. And after years of studying them from behind the cash register of her mom&#39;s porcelain-doll shop, she has seen nothing to prove otherwise. Enter Xander Spence&amp;#8212;he&#39;s tall, handsome, and oozing rich. Despite his charming ways and the fact that he seems to be one of the first people who actually gets her, she&#39;s smart enough to know his interest won&#39;t last. Because if there&#39;s one thing she&#39;s learned from her mother&#39;s warnings, it&#39;s that the rich have a short attention span. But just when Xander&#39;s loyalty and attentiveness are about to convince Caymen that being rich isn&#39;t a character flaw, she finds out that money is a much bigger part of their relationship than she&#39;d ever realized. With so many obstacles standing in their way, can she close the distance between them?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Underwater - Marisa Reichardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Morgan didn&#39;t mean to do anything wrong that day. Actually, she meant to do something &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;.  But her kind act inadvertently played a role in a deadly tragedy. In  order to move on, Morgan must learn to forgive-first someone who did  something that might be unforgivable, and then, herself. But Morgan  can&#39;t move on. She can&#39;t even move beyond the front door of the  apartment she shares with her mother and little brother. Morgan feels  like she&#39;s underwater, unable to surface. Unable to see her friends.  Unable to go to school. When it seems Morgan can&#39;t hold her breath any  longer, a new boy moves in next door. Evan reminds her of the salty  ocean air and the rush she used to get from swimming. He might be just  what she needs to help her reconnect with the world outside. &lt;i&gt;Underwater&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, hopeful debut novel about redemption, recovery, and finding the strength it takes to face your past and move on." />

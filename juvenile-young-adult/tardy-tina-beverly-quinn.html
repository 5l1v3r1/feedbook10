  <title>Tardy Tina - Beverly Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tina doesnt like to be late, but she cant help it. Theres just so much to do, and Tina is not good at managing her time. Her brother is always on time, so much so that her parents call him Timely Tommy. She wonders, why cant she be more like her brother? When shes late to a friends birthday party, Tina decides to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, change isnt easy. Tina will have to make a whole new schedule and learn what it means to be on time--and what it costs other people when she isnt. Being late affects the lives of everyone around her and sometimes hurts feelings. Tina doesnt want to be late, and she certainly doesnt want to hurt anyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for any young girl or boy who struggles with getting things done on time. Its important for children to learn from a young age that being timely is being responsible--and being responsible is important. Other peoples lives dont stop because of our tardiness, so why not be the first one to the party instead of missing out?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Father Time&#39;s Hope - Anita E. Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People used to make New Year&#39;s resolutions every year as they wished upon a star with hope that something great will take place in the next year. And it was that hope that brought the resolution to pass, kind of like magic! As people make their New Year&#39;s resolutions, the resolutions become the sand in a special hourglass that Father Time watches over called the New Year Hourglass. Now, also in that sand is the magic from all the wonderful Holidays that Brad and Chad have helped to save. The magic in the hourglass then meets each hopeful resolution when it tips over at the start of the New Year and brings it to pass. But, what if no one made any New Year&#39;s resolutions? What if there wasn&#39;t enough to tip the New Year Hourglass on New Year&#39;s Eve? Well, this story is about how not enough New Year&#39;s resolutions were made and Father Time has called upon Brad and Chad to help. But this will also need assistance from all the Holiday characters. Let&#39;s believe that nothing is impossible if there is hope in the heart." />

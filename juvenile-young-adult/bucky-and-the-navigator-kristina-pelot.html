  <title>Bucky and the Navigator - Kristina Pelot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Buckys world.
Bucky has always been kind of different from a normal seven-year-old.  He never has enough time in the day for all the adventures he dreams about. His trusted sidekick, the Navigator, helps with all the explorations. The Navigator has been with Bucky since birth. The Navigator was created by Buckys grandmother when he was born in honor of his grandfather, a World War II veteran of the air force. So with this, we can understand why the Navigator helps with courage and security they both need for each adventure.
Buckys family sees Bucky as a normal little boy except for the fact he doesnt ever want to participate socially with the other kids, unlike his older brother and other boys in the neighborhood who keep themselves busy with sports, all sports. Buckys parents and family members are unaware of his secret missions and the powers of the Navigator. Bucky dreams of the great adventure he and the Navigator will be asked to go on one day. 
Come join us in Bucky and the Navigators first adventure. I think you will agree he is an original boy wonder!" />

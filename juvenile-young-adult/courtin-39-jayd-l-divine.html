  <title>Courtin&#39; Jayd - L. Divine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just as South Bay High&#39;s Jayd Jackson is feeling good that her two main social circles have finally come together, drama takes over once more, and the usual suspects are involved.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  These days, family and relationship drama is the name of the game in Jayd&#39;s life--from her fighting uncles on the home front to her friend Mickey&#39;s possible pregnancy--aka her &quot;maybe baby&quot;--to a vengeful plan being plotted by Misty, Jayd&#39;s nemesis, over a highly personal problem. In fact, Jayd may have to do some plotting of her own to keep her crew safe from Misty&#39;s drama. Meanwhile, Rah is trying to get closer to Jayd, but she won&#39;t be his rebound girl. Everything comes to a head when Jayd&#39;s ex, Jeremy, asks to play basketball with Rah and the others and is told that a white boy can&#39;t ball. Jeremy proves them wrong, but will that be enough for them to let him on the team for an important game? Or will ego and stereotyping win? It&#39;s almost more than Jayd can take--until her Mama reminds her of her powerful lineage. Now it&#39;s time for Jayd to catch up on her spirit work, and confront some powerful emotions of her own.  .  ." />

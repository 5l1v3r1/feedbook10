  <title>Hold Me Closer, Necromancer - Lish McBride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam leads a pretty normal life. He may not have the most exciting job in the world, but he&#39;s doing all right--until a fast food prank brings him to the attention of Douglas, a creepy guy with an intense violent streak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out Douglas is a necromancer who raises the dead for cash and sees potential in Sam. Then Sam discovers he&#39;s a necromancer too, but with strangely latent powers. And his worst nightmare wants to join forces . . . or else.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only a week to figure things out, Sam needs all the help he can get. Luckily he lives in Seattle, which has nearly as many paranormal types as it does coffee places. But even with newfound friends, will Sam be able to save his skin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hold Me Closer, Necromancer&lt;/i&gt; is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />

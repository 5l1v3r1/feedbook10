  <title>Stinker from Space - Pamela F. Service</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Tsynq Yr, a Sylon scout and pilot, is flying a stolen spaceship behind the enemy lines of the Zarnk Empire. In the course of evading a Zarnk battleship, the Sylon crash-lands his vessel on Earth. Grave injuries force him to abandon his body and assume the form of the only available host &amp;#8212; a skunk! &lt;BR&gt;The alien&#39;s luck improves when he chances to meet Karen, a girl who dreams of space adventure. Thanks to his powers of telepathy, he can communicate with his new ally, who gives him the all-too-fitting nickname Stinker. Although he finds Earth technology primitive, Stinker is helpless to return to Sylon with crucial information for the battle against the Zarnk. Karen enlists her computer-savvy classmate, Jonathan, in carrying out an ambitious plan to &quot;borrow&quot; a space shuttle. In the meantime, the three must avoid drawing the attention of their families, NASA, and the Zarnk as well as the local skunk population. This&amp;nbsp;thrilling escapade will enchant young science-fiction fans.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

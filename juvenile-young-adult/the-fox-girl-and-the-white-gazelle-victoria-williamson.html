  <title>The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle - Victoria Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reema runs to remember the life she left behind in Syria. 
Caylin runs to find what she&#39;s lost.
Under the grey Glasgow skies, twelve-year-old refugee Reema is struggling to find her place in a new country, with a new language and without her brother. But she isn&#39;t the only one feeling lost. Her Glasgwegian neighbour Caylin is lonely and lashing out. 
When they discover an injured fox and her cubs hiding on their estate, the girls form a wary friendship. And they are more alike than they could have imagined: they both love to run. 
As Reema and Caylin learn to believe again, in themselves and in others, they find friendship, freedom and the discovery that home isn’t a place, it’s the people you love. 
Heartfelt and full of hope, The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle is an uplifting story about the power of friendship and belonging. Inspired by her work with young asylum seekers, debut novelist Victoria Williamson&#39;s stunning story of displacement and discovery will speak to anyone who has ever asked &#39;where do I belong?&#39;" />

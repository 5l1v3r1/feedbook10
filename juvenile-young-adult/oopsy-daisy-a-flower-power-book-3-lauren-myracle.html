  <title>Oopsy Daisy (A Flower Power Book #3) - Lauren Myracle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Flower Power books follow the funny fifth-grade adventures of four girls with little in common but their flower names who, nevertheless, blossom into the greatest of friends.&lt;BR&gt;Life for the Flower Power girls is never boring. With Milla still madly in crush with sweet Max, Katie-Rose is left wondering why everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t find fifth-grade boys as disgusting as she does. Especially pesky, annoying Preston, whose new favorite pastime is throwing erasers at Katie-Rose&amp;rsquo;s head and who always seems to be around at Katie-Rose&amp;rsquo;s most embarrassing moments. Yasaman isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready for a boyfriend either, but she does have a brilliant matchmaking plan for two of her favorite people, and she recruits the other girls to join. The targets: beloved teachers Mr. Emerson and Ms. Perez, who are meant for each other, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t know it. The goal: to bring those lovebirds together at their school&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Lock-In,&amp;rdquo; a teacher-chaperoned evening of fun, fabulosity, and possibly even romance. The trouble? Ms. Perez isn&amp;rsquo;t planning on coming. And when the fourth flower friend, Violet, mysteriously pulls out, too, it seems as if the Lock-In will be no fun at all. But these flowers don&amp;rsquo;t wilt so easily . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;Oopsy Daisy: A Flower Power Book &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;Myracle proves, once again, that she has her finger firmly on the pulse of tween girldom.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;I&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;Myracle perfectly captures the nuances of fifth-grade life.

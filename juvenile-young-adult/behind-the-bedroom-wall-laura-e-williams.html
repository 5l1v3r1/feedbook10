  <title>Behind the Bedroom Wall - Laura E. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s 1942. Thirteen-year-old Korinna Rehme is an active member of her local Jungmadel, a Nazi youth group, along with many of her friends. She believes that Hitler is helping Germany by instituting a program to deal with what he calls the &quot;Jewish problem,&quot; a program that she witnesses as her Jewish neighbors are attacked and taken from their homes. Korinna&#39;s parents, however, are members of a secret underground group providing a means of escape to the Jews of their city. Korinna is shocked to discover that they are hiding a refugee family behind the wall of her bedroom. But as she comes to know the family, her sympathies begin to turn. When someone tips off the Gestapo, loyalties are put to the test and Korinna must decide what she really believes and whom she really trusts. Filled with adventure, &lt;i&gt;Behind the Bedroom Wall&lt;/i&gt; helps readers understand the forces that drove so many to turn on their neighbors and the courage that allowed some to resist.&lt;/div&gt;" />

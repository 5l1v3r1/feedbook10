  <title>FAIRY CIRCLES - 10 Ancient Illustrated European Children&#39;s Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Translated from the German of Villa Maria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein you will find 10 European illustrated fairy tales and legends of giants, dwarfs, fairies, water-sprites and hobgoblins translated from the German of Villamaria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
Barbarossa&amp;#39;s Youthful Dream.&lt;br /&gt;
King Laurin&lt;br /&gt;
The Dwarf Of Venice&lt;br /&gt;
Rhine Gold&lt;br /&gt;
The Friendship Of The Dwarfs&lt;br /&gt;
The Flower Of Iceland&lt;br /&gt;
The Sea-Fairy&lt;br /&gt;
The Faithful Goblin&lt;br /&gt;
The Fallen Bell; and&lt;br /&gt;
The Last Home Of The Giants&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These tales come from a time when Europe had begun to awaken and kings, knights and men were starting to feel their way and construct a society which had honesty, honour, integrity and loyalty at its core. This was a time when men were knighted for good reason and shaking a man&amp;rsquo;s hand in agreement carried all of these qualities without them having to be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 10 full page pen and ink drawings, accompanied by a further 16 pen and ink vignettes, bring added depth and meaning to these most ancient of stories. Once you have read these stories to your children, we invite you to print these off and give them to your children to colour in.&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>Secrets of a Reluctant Princess - Casey Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At Beverly Hills High, you have to be ruthless to survive... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrianna Bottom always wanted to be liked. But this wasn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what she had in mind. Now, she&#39;s in the spotlight...and out of her geeky comfort zone. She&#39;ll do whatever it takes to turn the rumor mill in her favor--even if it means keeping secrets. So far, it&#39;s working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wear the right clothes. Say the right things. Be seen with the right people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin, the adorable sketch artist who shares her love of all things nerd, isn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the right people. But that doesn&#39;t stop Adrianna from crushing on him. The only way she can spend time with him is in disguise, as Princess Andy, the masked girl he&#39;s been LARPing with. If he found out who she really was, though, he&#39;d hate her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rules have been set. The teams have their players. Game on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

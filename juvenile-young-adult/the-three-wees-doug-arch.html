  <title>The Three Wees - Doug Arch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three sistersMatison, Mia, and Maceyare about to go on a big adventure they never expected. Their family often goes on camping trips, but one night, Matison suggests they change things up this time. Instead of going camping in a pop-up trailer, she wants to camp in tents. The girls mom and dad agree to this roughing it idea, and the family heads to the woods.
Things start normally enough as the three sisters eat around the campfire and head to bed. In the middle of the night, though, a big storm takes over their campsite! Their tent is blown this way and that, and the girls think they might even be flying in the air. When the storm ends, they cant find their parents because their tent did indeed fly far away.
Now Matison, Mia, and Macey are in a strange land with strange animals, and theres no sign of Mom or Dad. They have to find food, even if its only enough to make some honey sandwiches. Next, they need to find their way home. How will the girls get back to the world they know, and will the huge animals of these magical woods help in their journey to safety?" />

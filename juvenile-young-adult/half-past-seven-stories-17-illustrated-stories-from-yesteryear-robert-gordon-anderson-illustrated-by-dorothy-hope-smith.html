  <title>HALF-PAST SEVEN STORIES - 17 illustrated stories from yesteryear - Robert Gordon Anderson, Illustrated by Dorothy Hope Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 17 illustrated stories by Robert Gordon Anderson with 16 full-page colour &amp;nbsp;illustrations by Dorothy Hope Smith. This volume is the sequel to The Seven O&amp;#39;Clock Stories also written by Robert Gordon Anderson and with the same three happy children and are short stories of everyday happenings on a farm. The story of the Big Bobsled, even contains instructions on how to make your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The volume is introduced with &amp;quot;The Top Of The Morning&amp;quot; which is the saying the Toymaker uses as a greeting, no matter the weather which sets the tone of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories are:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Top Of The Morning&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;nbsp; The Little Lost Fox&lt;br /&gt;
II&amp;nbsp; The Big Bobsled&lt;br /&gt;
III&amp;nbsp; The Jolly Roger&lt;br /&gt;
IV&amp;nbsp; The Blue Croaker,&amp;nbsp; The Bright Agate, And&amp;nbsp; The Little Gray Mig&lt;br /&gt;
V&amp;nbsp; The Old Woman Who Lived On The Canal&lt;br /&gt;
VI&amp;nbsp; Two O&amp;#39; Cat&lt;br /&gt;
VII&amp;nbsp; The Fairy Lamp&lt;br /&gt;
VIII&amp;nbsp; The Animals&amp;#39; Birthday Party&lt;br /&gt;
IX&amp;nbsp; Dr. Philemon Pipp,&amp;nbsp; The Patient Medicine Man&lt;br /&gt;
X&amp;nbsp; When Jehosophat&amp;nbsp; Forgot His Piece&lt;br /&gt;
XI&amp;nbsp; Ole Man Pumpkin&lt;br /&gt;
XII&amp;nbsp; The Norway Spruce&lt;br /&gt;
XIII&amp;nbsp; When The Door Opened&lt;br /&gt;
XIV&amp;nbsp; The Hole That Ran&amp;nbsp; To China&lt;br /&gt;
XV&amp;nbsp; The Peppermint Pagoda&lt;br /&gt;
XVI&amp;nbsp; He That Took The City&lt;br /&gt;
These stories are simply and naturally told and are for children aged five to nine years old.&lt;br /&gt;
As with all children&amp;rsquo;s stories, they have originated in a place &amp;nbsp;where good wishes come true: where the poor and the lonely are rich and live in castles and have friends: and where sorrowful folk are happy. Here you will hear the birds singing and children laughing, all day long. The trees are full of blossoms and fruit. The sky is always blue, the grass green and soft. Under the trees dwell the fairies, and against the blue sky you will sometimes see the sheen of angels&amp;rsquo; wings as the flit by.&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to curl up with this unique sliver of Fairy culture not seen in print for over a century; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;

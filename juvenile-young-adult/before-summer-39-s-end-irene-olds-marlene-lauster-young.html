  <title>Before Summer&#39;s End - Irene Olds, Marlene Lauster Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We may reminisce about a first baby doll at Christmas or a Radio Flyer wagon long awaited. Recalling precious moments of youth, and the love held within them, is food for our souls. Such precious moments often escape us.
Before Summers End recalls a time and place in history that has escaped many of us. It was a time when being young meant carefree summers, running in the rain, and discovering the unknown. Within this story lie the innocence of youth, the true importance of family, and the way that little things in life hold true meaning.
Excitement fills the air while we wander through a summer day near the end of harvest time. We romp in the yard, chasing away the ducks as we search for gold. We watch a stray cat being squirted with milk and roll over in laughter until our bellies hurt. In the front yard, a rope swing patiently waits to take our breath away as it glides through the breeze. We remember the time when being young was easy and carefree.
Before Summers End reminds us of days past, when the pace of life was slower and one could savor its joy, feel its purity, and hold tightly to its truth. It was a time when children stood on a strong foundation that was built out of everyday, ordinary moments." />

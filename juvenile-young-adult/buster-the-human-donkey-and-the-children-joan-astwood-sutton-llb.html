  <title>Buster the Human Donkey and the Children - Joan Astwood-Sutton Llb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Buster the Human Donkey and the Children is about a jet-black donkey born in the wilds of Grand Turk, one of the Salt Islands in the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Busters ancestry was imported to Grand Turk during the Salt Industrys days and left them to roam free on the island.  He was later adopted by a large family with six children who took turn nursing him to an adult.    In his time with the family, Buster accepted the children in his life; he watched TV with them, danced, brayed, swam, played tricks, met people, and more.
Buster likes the islands culture, which is taught in the schools, especially the islands national music, which is called ripsaw.  He also like one of the local songs called I Dig and sing to his hearts content.  The island life is a breeze for him, and it is so wonderful that he could not help but express himself in whatever he does.  After attending classes, the children found out later that Buster could talk, and that brought on another level of fun for him and the children.  The children found out that there is never a doubt moment with Buster." />

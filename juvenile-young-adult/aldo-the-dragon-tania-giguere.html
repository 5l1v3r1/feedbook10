  <title>Aldo the Dragon - Tania Giguere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was another beautiful day for Aldo the Dragon as he awoke from his sweet dreamsdreams of his ancestors. Dragons were mighty, for they wielded love and kindness to all the people.
Aldo, being as powerful as his ancestors, also gave to his peoplethe villagers that he had come to love and respect.
Teaching the children the ways of helping each other and lending a hand gave Aldo great pleasure, for giving to one another was a great honor.
Aldo enjoyed that the children listened and asked questions because he was always ready to encourage the kids to learn.
Helping one another was a gift that Aldo wanted to place in the hearts of the children so that they could carry this gift to their families. Now working side by side with their parents, the village grew, and the children learned that to give themselves is a great honor." />

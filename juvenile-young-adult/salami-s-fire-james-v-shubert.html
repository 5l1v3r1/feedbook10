  <title>Salami’S Fire - James V. Shubert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hot August sun shone upon the southern slopes of Echo Gulch.  Wisps of hot smoke filtered through the duff of dead vegetation, igniting into a small flame.  The flame kindled dry vegetation around it, quickly growing bigger and bigger.  Energized by fresh oxygen, the fire increased into a ruddy blaze.  A light breeze whisked the fire along.  It spread rapidly, igniting everything in its path as it dashed up the mountainside.  The raging inferno climbed into the treetops, propelling tongues of fire and firebrands hundreds of feet into the sky.  The burning brands settled into the forest miles away, starting spot fires as they landed.  
Salamis home was in imminent danger.  Chatters had to take quick action to warn the forest critters of the massive fire and to save his family from devastation.  Salami and Bozzo teamed up, to assist Mom and Dad in saving the family farm. 
This is a heartwarming story of Salami, Bozzo and Chatters, who faced realistic and life-threatening challenges of fire and ice.   
Salami, a lovable, chubby, potbellied pig, shared the farm with Mom, Dad, and his best friend, the family dog Bozzo.  Their friend Chatters, the pine squirrel, lived in the nearby forest." />

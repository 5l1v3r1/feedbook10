  <title>Freeing Finch - Ginny Rorby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Ginny Rorby, the author of &lt;i&gt;Hurt Go Happy&lt;/i&gt;, winner of ALA&#39;s Schneider Family Book Award, comes &lt;i&gt;Freeing Finch&lt;/i&gt;, the inspiring story of a transgender girl and a stray dog who overcome adversity to find love, home, and a place to belong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her father leaves and her mother passes away soon afterward, Finch can&#39;t help feeling abandoned. Now she&#39;s stuck living with her stepfather and his new wife. They&#39;re mostly nice, but they don&#39;t believe the one true thing Finch knows about herself: that she&#39;s a girl, even though she was born in a boy&#39;s body.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully, she has Maddy, a neighbor and animal rescuer who accepts her for who she is. Finch helps Maddy care for a menagerie of lost and lonely creatures, including a scared, stray dog who needs a family and home as much as she does. As she earns the dog&#39;s trust, Finch realizes she must also learn to trust the people in her life--even if they are the last people she expected to love her and help her to be true to herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Armed with a switchblade, Sadie follows meager clues hoping they&#39;ll lead to the man who took Mattie&#39;s life, because she&#39;s determined to make him pay with his own. But as West traces her path to the darkest, most dangerous corners of big cities and small towns, a deeply unsettling mystery begins to unfold--one that&#39;s bigger than them both. Can he find Sadie before it&#39;s too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternating between Sadie&#39;s unflinching voice as she hunts the killer and the podcast transcripts tracking the clues she&#39;s left behind, &lt;i&gt;Sadie&lt;/i&gt; is a breathless thriller about the lengths we go to protect the ones we love and the high price we pay when we can&#39;t.

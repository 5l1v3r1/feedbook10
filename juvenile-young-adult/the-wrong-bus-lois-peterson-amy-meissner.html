  <title>The Wrong Bus - Lois Peterson, Amy Meissner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack loves and misses his bus-driving grandfather. When Grandpa Nod got sick, Jack&#39;s mother said eight-year-old Jack was too young to visit his grandfather in the hospital. When Grandpa Nod died, Jack&#39;s mother said Jack was too young to go to the funeral.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;One day after school, Jack gets on the wrong bus. To his surprise he discovers Grandpa Nod is in the driver&#39;s seat of the empty bus. Grandpa Nod takes him to all the places Jack was too young to go--the hospital, the funeral home and the cemetery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;By the end of the ride, Jack has had the chance to tell his grandfather how much he misses him. And with his birthday coming soon, Jack receives a very special gift--Grandpa Nod&#39;s bus schedules. So even if he does get on the wrong bus, Jack will always be able to find his way home." />

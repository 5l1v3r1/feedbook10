Carrying almost six hundred dollars, Mikes tent, and some groceries, they left their homes, leaving Mike to spread rumors as to where they were supposed to have gone. Actually, they camped out in the woods behind Mikes house at night and slipped through the door Mike left unlocked to eat and watch television during the day. 
Find out what adventures they had during the week they were gone, and how the police finally caught them. Did they gain the freedom they longed for?" />

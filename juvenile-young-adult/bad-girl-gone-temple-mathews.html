  <title>Bad Girl Gone - Temple Mathews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A recently deceased girl must solve her own murder in order to escape purgatory in&lt;i&gt; Bad Girl Gone &lt;/i&gt;by Temple Mathews.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen year-old Echo Stone awakens in a cold sweat in a dark room, having no idea where she is or how she got there. But she soon finds out she&#39;s in Middle House, an orphanage filled with mysteriously troubled kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just one problem: she&#39;s not an orphan. Her parents are very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains this to everyone, but no one will listen. After befriending a sympathetic (and handsome) boy, Echo is able to escape Middle House and rush home, only to discover it sealed off by crime scene tape and covered in the evidence of a terrible and violent crime. As Echo grapples with this world-shattering information, she spots her parents driving by and rushes to flag them down. Standing in the middle of street, waving her arms to get their attention, her parents&#39; car drives right through her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was right. Her parents are alive--but she&#39;s not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s a ghost, just like all the other denizens of Middle House. Desperate to somehow get her life back and reconnect with her still-alive boyfriend, Echo embarks on a quest to solve her own murder. As the list of suspects grows, the quest evolves into a journey of self-discovery in which she learns she wasn&#39;t quite the girl she thought she was. In a twist of fate, she&#39;s presented with one last chance to reclaim her life and must make a decision which will either haunt her or bless her forever.­­­­&lt;/p&gt;" />

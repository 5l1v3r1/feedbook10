  <title>The Cow Jumped over the Moon … and Then Ate All the Chocolate - Paige Deale, Christopher M. Nemeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cow jumped over the moon and then decided to eat every last bit of chocolate on Earth. She eats and eats until everyone goes into a panic. What will they do without chocolate chips for cookies or frosting for cupcakes? The president declares a state of emergency, and the search is on for the now missing Cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a mad search, they finally find her on the moon, enjoying the very last bit of chocolate with a satisfied smile. Cow doesnt care a bit that shes eaten all the chocolate and left nothing for the children of the world. Shes taken back down to Earth where she must be punished, but what will her punishment be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must fix the chocolate situation, and slowly, Cow begins to realize that what shes done is selfish and wrong. She must find a way to make the children happy again and get the chocolate back. Its not too late, as the judge come up with the perfect punishment for Cow and the perfect solution to the chocolate drought!&lt;/p&gt;" />

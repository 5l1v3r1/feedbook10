  <title>Mommy, Please Let Me Live - Pearl Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like many teenage girls, Tracey cannot wait until she turns sixteen. She will finally be able to date, something most teenage girls eagerly anticipate. Before long, she begins to date Troyand that is when her life changes.
In Mommy, Please Let Me Live: Voice of the Unborn, author Pearl Robinson tells Traceys story. Before she turns sixteen, Tracey talks to her parents about everything and never lies to them. But when she turns sixteen and start dating, Tracey begins to lie to her parents. She starts skipping school to be with Troy, who eventually pressures her to have sex with him. And when Tracey finds out she is pregnant, she is left with a life-changing question: should she keep her baby or have an abortion?
Robinson takes readers through Traceys decision process and the changing relationship with her parents and friends. They will also learn how important it is to consider the consequences before doing something it seems everyone else is doing. 
Although Mommy, Please Let Me Live is fiction, Robinson tells a story with which many teens are familiar. Traceys story includes pain and desperation, but also one of hope." />

  <title>Madman on a Drum - David Housewright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Homicide cop Bobby Dunston&#39;s daughter has been kidnapped, taken in broad daylight on a city street in the middle of September. The kidnappers demand a million dollars and force Dunston to get the ransom from his friend Mac McKenzie. It soon becomes apparent to the two of them that one of the kidnappers is childhood pal Scottie, a once aspiring drummer now gone astray, and that the kidnapping is payback for &quot;crimes&quot; committed in their past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie, former cop and now unlicensed P.I., handles the ransom drop-off and the child is returned safely.  But Scottie is found dead---brutally murdered---and someone has taken out an open contract on McKenzie, using his own money to pay for it.  Dodging attempts on his life from assassins of all shapes and sizes, McKenzie now has precious little time to uncover the mastermind behind it all if he&#39;s going to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Madman on a Drum &lt;/i&gt;is another thrilling entry in David Housewright&#39;s hard-boiled mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />

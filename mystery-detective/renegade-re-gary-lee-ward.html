  <title>Renegade Re - Gary Lee Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ozzie Grinn inherits the largest insurance company in the world. Everything runs smoothly for nearly three years, but then he suddenly discovers that in just a matter of weeks or possibly even days, he could lose the entire insurance empire his deceased father, H. Martin Grinn, III, worked a lifetime to build.
Racing against the clock to thwart the hostile takeover attempt, Ozzie and his wife, Sly, enlist the help of some of the sharpest minds in the worldfour people theyd trust with their lives. But the group quickly finds that its no simple task to stop the small reinsurance company, Monolith Re, from swallowing up Lions Grinn International.
While Ozzies team search frantically for answers in the U.S. and Europe, Ozzie and one of his closest friends are nearly gunned down and then kidnapped on a street in London.
Meanwhile, as ridiculous as it seems, the possibility looms larger by the hour that the largest, most prestigious insurance company in the world will be taken over by a tiny, renegade, reinsurer! 
Ozzie and his wife are shocked beyond words when they finally learn whos behind the takeover attempt." />

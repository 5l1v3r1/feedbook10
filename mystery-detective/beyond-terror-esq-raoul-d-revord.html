  <title>Beyond Terror - Esq. Raoul D. Revord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She would be severely beaten and likely killed if she stayed, but certainly killed if she tried to leave. Was it self-defense, or was it murder? To defend his client, one lawyer from Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Upper Peninsula must find the truth in forensic evidence and through a sensational trial, portray to the jury a drama of the life of Jean and John Davis. Revord&amp;rsquo;s Beyond Terror tells readers this gripping story of a battered wife who suddenly is left no choice but to end years of domestic violence by killing her abusive husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney David Chartier was spending quality time with his family in their cabin near the Upper Twin Lake when a phone call from a highly distressed woman broke the peace and serenity of that evening. It was Jean Davis, David&amp;rsquo;s longtime client, calling from the Michigan State Police Post where she is being held for her husband&amp;rsquo;s murder. After years of physical and emotional abuse, Jean abruptly realized that her only chance of staying alive was to kill her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins David&amp;rsquo;s investigation, examination, gathering and analysis of forensic evidence that will provide a defense for his client. Beyond Terror follows the proceedings of the trial, beginning with David&amp;rsquo;s investigation at the scene until the final verdict from the jury and appellate decision of the Court of Appeals. A shocking and unexpected end to the novel awaits readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial lawyer for forty-five years himself, Revord delivers this fictional story&amp;mdash; inspired largely on real events&amp;mdash;with much precision, capturing the technicalities and the drama involved in criminal proceedings.

      <meta name="description" content="Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson have just finished a rather substantial breakfast when they hear a sharp rap at the door, announcing the unexpected arrival of a clerk from the Colonial Office.

After the two detectives meet the prime minister in the shadows of a gentlemans club, they learn they have been called upon to travel to the Yukon and rout elements that threaten British stability. As the two true British patriots begin an epic journey far from the comforts of Baker Street, they must not only brave the dangers and hardships of the northern Canadian wilds, but also determine the line between a patriot and a scoundreldeceit and violenceall while looking inward at their own weaknesses.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Peril in the Yukon&lt;/i&gt; is a unique and compelling tale that highlights the rollicking, spirited adventure of two unforgettable detectives as they traipse through unfamiliar climes to track down a culprit." />

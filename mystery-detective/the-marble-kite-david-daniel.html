  <title>The Marble Kite - David Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Private investigator Alex Rasmussen has loved carnivals since he was a boy, and what better way to enjoy one as a grown man than with a lovely woman at his side? As he and his date stroll along the midway, playing games of chance, the soft September night is torn by a scream. Rasmussen rushes to a nearby field to find a woman&#39;s body in the weeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the carnival workers---a man with trouble in his past and a motive for murder---is arrested and charged with the crime. The lawyer hired to defend him retains Rasmussen to investigate. The police are convinced they have a clear-cut case, but as Alex probes, he finds a trail as bewildering as a funhouse mirror maze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outsider to the close-knit &quot;carnies,&quot; and shunned by the police department he once served, Rasmussen faces a client who refuses to talk, gangsters looking to exploit the carnival&#39;s troubles, a mob of citizens bent on rough justice, and an elusive killer who seems to anticipate Alex&#39;s every move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the investigation points to crooked cops, the defending lawyer abandons the case. Wisdom says Rasmussen should do likewise, but staying on has become a matter of honor. As a woman tells him, &quot;We all end up in the graveyard, flying the marble kite.&quot; The only question now is: When?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the old city of Lowell (once the textile capital of America, now a husk of run-down mills), the streets have never been meaner. Beyond the flickering lights and the bright surfaces lies a shadow world where betrayal, deception, and violent death await.&lt;/p&gt;" />

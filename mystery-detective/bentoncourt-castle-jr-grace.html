      <meta name="description" content="In the summer of 1952, Samantha(Sam) O&#39;Brien comes home to the sleepy New England town of Whalesport (after losing her prestigious teaching job on the west coast) to fulfill her secret wish and begin her career as a private detective with her old man, an ex-police officer, only to find that he has died just before she arrives. Stunned and saddened she wonders if she will be taken seriously now in this new venture or if she even wants to be a detective without him. So while getting her affairs in order, the death of an old flame under dubious circumstances help her make up her mind and lead her into the realm of the underworld, where the social elite mix with gangsters who conduct dastardly deeds. At times solemn, at times lighthearted, this is a tale of amateur detectives, who work their way through an intriguing cast of villains and corrupt officials only to find that sometimes good guys don&#39;t finish last or get their man." />

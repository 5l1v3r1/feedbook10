  <title>Purrder She Wrote - Cate Conte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Purrder She Wrote&lt;/i&gt; is second in the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;paws&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;itively charming new feline mystery series from Cate Conte set off the New England coast, where curiosity leads to some killer small-town secrets....  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s the grand opening of Daybreak Island&#39;s cat café, where customers can get cozy with an assortment of friendly felines--and maybe even take one or a few home. Co-owner Maddie James is purring with excitement over her new warm-and-fuzzy venture. . .until she becomes entangled in a petty drama between one of her volunteers, an ardent animal-rights activist, and a wealthy woman who insists on adopting a calico kitty--&lt;i&gt;right this instant&lt;/i&gt;. The catfight that ensues is bad enough for business. But when the snubbed socialite is found dead with a tell-tale catnip toy on the scene, suspicion lands squarely on Maddie&#39;s staffer. Now, with her reputation and her career prospects on the line (to say nothing of her budding romance with a handsome pet groomer) Maddie must do whatever it takes to solve the crime--before her nine lives are up.&lt;/p&gt;" />

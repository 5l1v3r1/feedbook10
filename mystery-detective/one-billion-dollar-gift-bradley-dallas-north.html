  <title>One Billion Dollar$ Gift - Bradley Dallas North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1948: When contact is lost with the two B-29s carrying the precious cargo for Operation Halo Glo, the operation quickly escalates into a highly classified rescue mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the planes take off from the Philippine Islands to start on a long journey back to the United States, they appear to be a part of a standard training exercise. However, this is not a normal mission. The top-secret assignment has taken over six months of preparation, including major modifications to the planes and the selection of special crewmen. By the time the day is over, their mission turns into the largest recovery project in the history of the United States. Years later, Gil Downey and his team&#39;s security leader, Bradley North, are called on to assist in the recovery effort. The first priority is to bring home the remains of the crewmen and airmen that went down in the planes. The rest of the cargo will be brought home under a covert operation, due to the valuable and deadly nature of the cargo itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort takes Downey and North to the edge of trust and challenges everything they presume to know about each other. The first in a trilogy, &lt;I&gt;One Billion Dollar$ Gift&lt;/I&gt; will take you on a worldwide adventure through the mind of author Bradley North." />

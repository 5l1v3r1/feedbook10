  <title>The Good Thief&#39;s Guide to Berlin - Chris Ewan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t keep a good thief down . . . Charlie Howard is back and robbing the city of Berlin blind, until he witnesses a murder being committed right before his eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Howard, part-time writer, part-time thief, has been engaged in a veritable spree of larceny and misappropriation since moving to Berlin, Germany. He&#39;s supposed to be working on his next novel. But high rent and a love for thrill-seeking has been hard on his word count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Charlie&#39;s larcenous binge is interrupted by the call to duty--on behalf of Her Majesty&#39;s Government. Four embassy employees are suspected of stealing a sensitive item. Charlie is to break into their homes, find the culprit and recover the stolen property. But there&#39;s a catch. The item is so sensitive, Charlie isn&#39;t told what he&#39;s looking for. Not its size, not its weight, nothing. He&#39;s only told that he&#39;ll recognize it when he sees it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie has been a successful thief because he follows his own rules, the first being &quot;Don&#39;t get caught.&quot; Well, after he enters the first suspect&#39;s home, he has to add a new rule: &quot;Don&#39;t admire the view.&quot; As Charlie stares across the street, he sees something he really wishes he hadn&#39;t--a woman being murdered. And that&#39;s just for starters. What follows is a wild adventure in the former cauldron of spies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Good Thief&#39;s Guide to Berlin&lt;/i&gt;, Chris Ewan shows why he was voted as one of America&#39;s favorite British authors by a &lt;i&gt;Huffington Post &lt;/i&gt;poll. Clever and wildly entertaining, this is a mystery series that is &quot;big fun&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />

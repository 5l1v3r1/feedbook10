  <title>There Comes a Moment... - Andrew Carmitchel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the early dawn of a summer morning in July, Jonathon Parker is awakened by a scream and runs outside to find his neighbor standing over a dead body. Suddenly, the harmony that has surrounded his peaceful cul-de-sac for years is shattered.&lt;p&gt; 
An eyeless, hairless head of a corpse is not what Jon expects to see on his suburban lawn first thing in the morning, yet overnight, he and his neighbors are unwillingly cast into a nightmare of horrific proportions. All of a sudden, something is consuming his quiet little neighborhood in Highland, Illinois, and no one can explain why. Unfortunately, the first dead body will not be the last, and what follows in the days and especially the nights to come will forever change the lives of those who live on one street, in the middle of one town, in one part of the country.&lt;p&gt; 
The Devonshire cul-de-sac residents are decent people who thought they were ready for anything ... but it turns out no one is ready to face a ruthless killer seeking vengeance." />

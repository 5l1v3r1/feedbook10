  <title>Down Don&#39;t Bother Me - Jason Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hugely entertaining debut&amp;#8212;the first novel in a wickedly funny gothic mystery series set in the withering landscape of the southern Illinois coal country known as &amp;#8220;little Egypt&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;that blends the wry humor of Kevin Wilson, the dark violence of Urban Waite, and the electric atmosphere of Greg Iles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the depths of the Knight Hawk, one of the last working collieries in downstate Illinois, the body of a reporter is found, his mini-recorder tied around his neck and a notepad stuffed in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Knight Hawk&amp;#8217;s owner, Matthew Luster, isn&amp;#8217;t happy. He wants answers&amp;#8212;and he doesn&amp;#8217;t want the cops or any more press poking into his business. To protect himself and the operation, he turns to Slim, a mine employee with a reputation for &amp;#8220;bloodhounding&amp;#8221;-finding lost souls when the police can&amp;#8217;t or won&amp;#8217;t.

But when you make a deal with the devil, you&amp;#8217;re going to get burned . . . . and now Slim is all too close to the flames. Circumstances have lead him into the grimy underworld of Little Egypt, Illinois&amp;#8212;a Babel&amp;#8217;s Tower of rednecks, rubes, freaks, tweakers, gun nuts, and aging hippies-and it quickly becomes clear that he&amp;#8217;s much more involved in the murder than an innocent man should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down Don&amp;#8217;t Bother Me &lt;/em&gt;marks the emergence of a wildly assured mystery novelist, and of a series set in the fresh and brutal landscape of southern Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Miss Dimple and the Slightly Bewildered Angel - Mignon F. Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;October, 1944.  It has been a challenging season for Elderberry&#39;s  favorite first grade teacher, Miss Dimple Kilpatrick. A beloved former  student was recently killed in the war, her brother has become distant,  and her friend Odessa, the cook at Pheobe&#39;s rooming house, has taken a  leave of absence to care for a relative. Still, when Dimple&#39;s librarian  friend, Virginia, finds a young woman, Dora, on the library porch  looking for a place to spend the night, soft-hearted Dimple brings her  back to Phoebe&#39;s and offers her food and a warm coat. But when Dimple is  trying to find her a place to sleep, the young girl disappears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  next morning, Miss Dimple answers a knock on the door expecting it to  be the girl. Instead, she is greeted by greeted by a somewhat disheveled  young woman with lustrous hair and a sunrise of a smile who claims she  has been assigned to fill in at the house. Augusta Goodnight, a guardian  angel who has been summoned from a well-deserved rest after a series of  troublesome earthly duties, has taken up at Phoebe&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When  Dora  is discovered dead - murdered - the real reason for Augusta&#39;s  &quot;assignment&quot; becomes clear, at least to Augusta. Reluctantly, Miss  Dimple teams up with Augusta to find out who the killer is.&lt;/p&gt;" />

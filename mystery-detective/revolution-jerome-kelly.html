  <title>Revolution - Jerome Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the year 2062. Having been culturally uplifted by an extraterrestrial race, Earth is now a member of a galactic alliance of races. Unfortunately, the Human races short time among this peaceful group has been brought to an end by war. The Vulians, an aggressive and violent race, have successfully conquered each of the ten races of the Tolian alliance along with Earth too. Faced with overwhelming odds, the vast majority of the military forces of the once mighty races of the galaxy are now all but eliminated and only a few people remain capable of fighting back against the oppressors.
In the middle of the chaos, two young cadets, James Tavarez and Amario Richards, have begun to fight back against the Vulian empire and for almost two years, they have disrupted their operations enough to make themselves two of the galaxys most wanted men.
With the ruthless Vulian military closing in on them, James and Amario are forced to flee their home-world, Earth, and travel to the planet Tolis where they believe the military have prepared a safe place for them to hide. What they come to realise is that their part in events is merely beginning and they have been called to join a revolution against the Vulian empire... One that they hope will finally overthrow the Vulian occupiers and restore order to the galaxy." />

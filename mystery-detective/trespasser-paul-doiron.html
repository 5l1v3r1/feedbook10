  <title>Trespasser - Paul Doiron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Paul Doiron&#39;s riveting follow-up to his Edgar Award-nominated novel, &lt;i&gt;The Poacher&#39;s Son&lt;/i&gt;, Maine game warden Mike Bowditch&#39;s quest to find a missing woman leads him through a forest of lies in search of a killer who may have gotten away with murder once before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While on patrol one foggy March evening, Bowditch receives a call for help. A woman has reportedly struck a deer on a lonely coast road. When the game warden arrives on the scene, he finds blood in the road--but both the driver and the deer have vanished. And the state trooper assigned to the accident appears strangely unconcerned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The details of the disappearance seem eerily familiar. Seven years earlier, a jury convicted lobsterman Erland Jefferts of the rape and murder of a wealthy college student and sentenced him to life in prison. For all but his most fanatical defenders, justice was served. But when the missing woman is found brutalized in a manner that suggests Jefferts may have been framed, Bowditch receives an ominous warning from state prosecutors to stop asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For Bowditch, whose own life was recently shattered by a horrific act of violence, doing nothing is not an option. His clandestine investigation reopens old wounds between Maine locals and rich summer residents and puts both his own life and that of the woman he loves in jeopardy. As he closes in on his quarry, he suddenly discovers how dangerous his opponents are, and how far they will go to prevent him from bringing a killer to justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />

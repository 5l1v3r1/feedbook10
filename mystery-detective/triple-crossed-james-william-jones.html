  <title>Triple Crossed - James William Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An urgent midnight call from the Vatican awakens Dr. Joseph McPherson, a former CIA scientist, from a drunken sleep. He is summoned to Rome to help recover the most sacred relics in Christendom, known only to the Pope and a handful of cardinals. The mere existence of these relics could cast doubts on the very foundations of Christianity; they must be recovered quickly and covertly to preserve the Church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Israel, Mossad director Meir Snir has taken notice. He questions why the Vatican would appoint an alcoholic research nerd to team with five Vatican cardinals and the Pope himself, on any project. Snir, who has a sixth sense for intrigue, wonders if this development could have long-reaching implications. He dispatches the clever and beautiful Myra Cohen to keep an eye on McPherson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During McPhersons quest to solve this biblical yet timely puzzle,  he encounters an ancient and secret brotherhood that has vowed to  seek revenge for past atrocities and destroy the Catholic Church. The dangerous trail leads through England, Kentucky Bluegrass country, Washington DC, and Amsterdam in search of a mysterious genius who may have unraveled the secret of eternal life. On his journey, McPherson learns the innermost secrets of the Vatican as well as how to resurrect his own life." />

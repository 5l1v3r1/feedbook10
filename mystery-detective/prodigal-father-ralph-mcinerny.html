  <title>Prodigal Father - Ralph McInerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Father Roger Dowling is a busy man. He&#39;s got the ambitious and all-encompassing task of running St. Hilary&#39;s Parish, dealing with his busybody housekeeper, Mrs. Murkin, and counseling his flock with his characteristic blend of faith and compassion. He&#39;s not complaining, but it&#39;s no surprise that even a superior priest like Father Dowling needs a break now and again. So off he heads for a week-long retreat in Indiana on the quiet grounds of an old Catholic religious order, where he can meditate, reflect, and pray for a quick recharge of his waning energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Father Dowling&#39;s spiritual retreat turns into a baffling murder investigation when a dead man is found in a grotto on the grounds with the handle of an axe protruding from his back. Complicating matters is a long-running real-estate dispute that has pitted the brothers of the order against the previous owners of the huge and valuable piece of land on which their sanctuary sits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who could have killed the man and why, and does it have something to do with the high-stakes mind games being played out between the parties vying for the land? No one&#39;s too sure, but what is clear is that Father Dowling is once again at the center of it all in another winning entry in a mystery series that&#39;s become an institution.&lt;/p&gt;" />

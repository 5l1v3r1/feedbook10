  <title>Precinct Puerto Rico - Steven Torres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Near Rincón, Puerto Rico, 1987.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even a tropical paradise may have its little murders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  his years as sheriff of Angustias, a small town nestled in Puerto  Rico&#39;s mountainous heart, Luis Gonzalo has seen his share of violence.  People kill for love and money in Angustias just as they do anywhere  else. But it is during a visit to his wife&#39;s family in the seaside town  of Rincón that Gonzalo encounters his greatest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  midnight call brings Gonzalo to a beach where bodies are washing ashore,  victims of a shipwreck, victims of the illegal traffic in humans from  the Dominican Republic. When he discovers evidence that the shipwreck  was no accident, that the ship&#39;s captain was murdered, Gonzalo&#39;s life is  threatened. When he discovers proof that Puerto Rican police were  involved in the deaths of the illegal immigrants, the lives of his wife  and children are threatened. The murder of one of his deputies brings  Gonzalo no closer to the bottom of this mystery-- a mystery no other law  enforcement agency wants to help him solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first in a series of police procedural mysteries featuring Luis Gonzalo and the citizens  and cops of Angustias, &lt;i&gt;Precinct Puerto Rico: Book One&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant beginning to a continuing story from a long overdue locale.&lt;/p&gt;" />

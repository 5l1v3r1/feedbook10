  <title>What We Did - Christobel Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He stole her childhood . . . she&#39;ll take his future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something happened, she didn&#39;t know what, something spun, the world turning, back, back, too fast. She would be sick. Bridget put out a hand to steady herself against the wall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bridget has a secret--one she keeps from everyone, even her husband. One that threatens to explode when her childhood music teacher, Carmichael, walks into her dress shop. With him is a young girl on the cusp of adulthood, fresh-faced and pretty. She reminds Bridget of herself at that age, naïve and vulnerable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bridget wants him away--away from her, away from that girl. But Carmichael won&#39;t leave her alone, won&#39;t stop stalking her. And Bridget&#39;s not a little girl anymore. When he pushes her too far, she snaps. But what she thought was a decisive act only unravels more insidious threats--more than she could have ever imagined--and from which no one is safe, not even her family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bestselling British author Christobel Kent has written yet another thrilling page-turner with a twisted, riveting conclusion. &lt;i&gt;What We Did&lt;/i&gt; is a nightmarish, impossible-to-put-down tale of the secrets we keep from our families, of chilling childhood abuse, and of long-awaited retribution.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Case of the Green Felt Hat - Christopher Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;George Wharton said he hoped I&amp;rsquo;d have a nice murder for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovic Travers and his wife choose to spend part of their honeymoon in the quiet town of Edensthorpe&amp;mdash;one place where they can be sure of peace and quiet, and where an eminent author and his famous wife might not be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them, however, another fugitive has sought anonymity in the nearby village of Pettistone&amp;mdash;a swindler named Brewse who has just completed a prison sentence for fraud. Brewse has made an unfortunate choice of home, because the leading citizens of Pettistone all suffered serious financial losses as a result of his fraudulent dealings, and they unite in an effort to drive him away from the village. Before they can do so, however, somebody decides upon a more permanent method of getting rid of Brewse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovic Travers cannot, once again, resist the temptation to use his powers of insight and detection to discover the murderer of the man in the green hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Case of the Green Felt Hat&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1939. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travers&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;As for my methods of crime detection&amp;mdash;well, I haven&amp;rsquo;t any. For that my only tool is a brain that has been called agile, sharpened on crosswords rather than chess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />

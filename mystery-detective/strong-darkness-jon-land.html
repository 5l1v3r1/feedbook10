      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong returns in her most thrilling adventure yet in Jon Land&#39;s STRONG DARKNESS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1883:&lt;/i&gt; Texas Ranger William Ray Strong teams up with Judge Roy Bean to track down the Old West&#39;s first serial killer, who&#39;s stitching a trail of death along the railroad lines slicing their way through Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Present:&lt;/i&gt; Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong finds herself pursuing another serial killer whose methods are eerily similar to the one pursued by her great-grandfather almost a century-and-a-half before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s just the beginning of her problems. The son of her boyfriend is nearly beaten to death at Brown University. The investigation leads back to Texas and to the Chinese high-tech company awarded the contract to build the US&#39;s 5G network. Li Zhen, the company&#39;s founder, counts that as the greatest achievement of his career, but it hides his true motivations&lt;i&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;nothing less than China&#39;s total domination of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His plan is backed by elements of the Chinese underworld. Up against an army at Li&#39;s disposal, Caitlin blazes a violent trail across country and continent in search of secrets hidden in the past, but it&#39;s a secret from the present that holds the key. Darkness is coming, and only Caitlin Strong can find the light before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

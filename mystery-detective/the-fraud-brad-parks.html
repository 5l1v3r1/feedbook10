  <title>The Fraud - Brad Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Fraud&lt;/i&gt;, the most thrilling entry yet in Brad Parks&#39;s award-winning series, investigative reporter Carter Ross must chose who gets to live: him or his unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rash of carjackings terrorizing Newark become newsworthy when one such theft ends in the murder of a wealthy banking executive. The affable, wisecracking Ross is assigned the story, but he&#39;s weary of only writing about victims of crime who happen to be rich and white. To balance his reporting, he finds a Nigerian immigrant of more modest means who was also killed during a recent carjacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it turns out the two victims knew each other, sharing an unexplained round of golf at a tony country club shortly before their deaths, Carter is plunged onto the trail of a deadly band of car thieves that includes a sociopathic ex-convict. When his unborn child is put in harm&#39;s way, it becomes more than just a story for Carter. And he&#39;ll stop at nothing to rescue the baby-even if it costs him his own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks, a rising star on the crime fiction scene known for his mix of wit and grit, delivers his most emotionally resonant book yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />

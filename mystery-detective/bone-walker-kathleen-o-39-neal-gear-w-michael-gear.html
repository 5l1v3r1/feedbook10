  <title>Bone Walker - Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear, W. Michael Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear, award-winning archaeologists and international bestselling authors, break extraordinary new ground in the riveting sequel to their bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Summoning God&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Bone Walker&lt;/i&gt; is more than a murder mystery, it is a psychological thriller filled with the action that have made this the dynamic duo of the historical.  They have breathed life into the vanished world of the Anasazi, bringing out the spirit, the loves, and a mysterious world where mystery and horror lurk in every shadow, behind every door, sometimes right before you.  The Gears invite you to follow them down the dark labyrinth of the serial killers mind in Book III of the &lt;i&gt;Anasazi Mysteries&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight hundred years have passed since the Mogollon holy man was murdered in Flowing Waters Town. The threads of evil spun by Two Hearts are drawn across time to ensnare modern archaeologists Dusty Stewart and Maureen Cole. The &quot;Wolf Witch&quot; has killed archaeologist Dale Emerson Robertson, and Dusty and Maureen must unmask the murderer before he strikes again. But in so doing, Dusty will root out disturbing secrets about his own past that will cast his father&#39;s suicide in an unsettling light. With so many skeletons in the closet, even a bone expert like Maureen can be baffled...and the Wolf Witch is two steps ahead of them, drawing them relentlessly into his trap...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the national award-winning archaeologists and international bestselling authors of The Visitant and The Summoning God comes a novel of unforgettable terror about a murder in America eight hundred years ago...and a power that transcends time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

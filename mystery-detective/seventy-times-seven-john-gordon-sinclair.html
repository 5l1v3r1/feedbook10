      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Danny  McGuire doesn&#39;t like his job, but he&#39;s good at it. Since his brother&#39;s  murder eight years earlier he has become a professional killer: a hit  man for hire, bent on retribution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Job: &lt;/b&gt;Danny&#39;s been  contracted to eliminate the &#39;Thevshi&#39; - the Ghost - the most elusive  informant that has ever penetrated the Republican movement in Northern  Ireland. But there&#39;s a problem: the Thevshi claims to know who&#39;s  responsible for his brother&#39;s death.

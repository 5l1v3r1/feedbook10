  <title>The Magdalen Martyrs - Ken Bruen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack Taylor is walking the delicate edge of a sobriety he doesn&#39;t trust when his phone rings. He&#39;s in debt to a Galway tough named Bill Cassell, what the locals call a &quot;hard man.&quot; Bill did Jack a big favor a while back; the trouble is, he never lets a favor go unreturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack is amazed when Cassell simply asks him to track down a woman, now either dead or very old, who long ago helped his mother escape from the notorious Magdalen laundry, where young wayward girls were imprisoned and abused. Jack doesn&#39;t like the odds of finding the woman, but counts himself lucky that the task is at least on the right side of the law.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until he spends a few days spinning his wheels and is dragged in front of Cassell for a quick reminder of his priorities. Bill&#39;s goons do a little spinning of their own, playing a game of Russian roulette a little too close to the back of Jack&#39;s head. It&#39;s only blind luck and the mercy of a god he no longer trusts that land Jack back on the street rather than face down in a cellar with a bullet in his skull. He&#39;s got one chance to stay alive: find this woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he can&#39;t escape his own curiosity, and an unnerving hunch quickly turns into a solid fact: just who Jack&#39;s looking for, and why, aren&#39;t nearly what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magdalen Martyrs&lt;/i&gt;, the third Galway-set novel by Edgar, Barry, and Macavity finalist and Shamus Award-winner Ken Bruen, is a gripping, dazzling story that takes the Jack Taylor series to explosive new heights of suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />

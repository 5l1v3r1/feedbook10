      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#x2018;This book was &lt;b&gt;fantastic&lt;/b&gt; and it kept me &lt;b&gt;gripped from the first page&lt;/b&gt; and I &lt;b&gt;read it in a day, I really, really didn&#39;t want to put it down&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x2013; it&amp;#x2019;s one of the &lt;b&gt;best I&#39;ve read so far in 2017&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x2026;&amp;#xa0;Would not hesitate to give the book &lt;b&gt;5 stars!!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Donna&amp;#x2019;s Book Blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Colourful, plastic boats were scattered in puddles on the floor. In the bathtub lay Linda Upton, fully-clothed, lips a shade of blue, and bloodshot eyes wide open.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young mother is found drowned in the bath, clutching a receipt saying &amp;#x2018;all debts paid&amp;#x2019;, &lt;b&gt;Detective Robyn Carter&lt;/b&gt; knows it&amp;#x2019;s just the beginning of a harrowing case.&amp;#xa0;She recognises the signs of a serial killer, and a second victim with a receipt confirms her worst fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no witnesses. The victims had no debts. With the body count rising and the local press whipping the public into a frenzy, Robyn is under pressure to solve the crime in record time. But her team can&amp;#x2019;t find a link between the victims, and the cracks are starting to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when her leads have dried up, Robyn discovers photographs in two of the victims&amp;#x2019; houses, which she thinks could unlock the case. But as she hones in on the killer&amp;#x2019;s shocking motive, one of her own is put in terrible danger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Robyn stop the most twisted killer of her career before it&amp;#x2019;s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heart-pounding, toe-curling, one-sitting serial killer thriller that will hook you from the first page till the last.

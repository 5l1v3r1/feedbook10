  <title>Well Bred and Dead - Catherine O&#39;Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newly widowed Pauline Cook was once the toast of the Windy City elite&amp;#8212;but now she&#39;s practically broke. At least she&#39;s in better shape than her dear departed friend Ethan Campbell, whose corpse Pauline has had the misfortune to discover. A writer who chronicled the lives, loves, and ensembles of the Gold Coast&#39;s most elegant ladies, Ethan apparently took his own life&amp;#8212;while inelegantly clad in old boxers, no less. And since no relatives are coming forward to claim Ethan&#39;s remains, it falls to Pauline to settle his final affairs . . . with her own dwindling funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are things about Ethan&#39;s suicide that don&#39;t seem to add up: the ratty undergarments he &quot;chose&quot; to die in, for example . . . and the multiple birth certificates the police turn up in his apartment. Before she can truly lay her friend to rest, plucky Pauline&#39;s determined to get to the bottom of his increasingly suspicious death. &lt;/p&gt;" />

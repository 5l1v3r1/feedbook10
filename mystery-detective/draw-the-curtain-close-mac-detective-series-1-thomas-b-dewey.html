  <title>Draw the Curtain Close: Mac Detective Series #1 - Thomas B. Dewey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PORTRAIT OF A PRIVATE COP...&lt;P&gt; &quot;Call me Mac... I&#39;m just a guy. I go around and get in jams and then try to figure a way out of them. I don&#39;t make very much money and most people insult me one way or another... I&#39;m a fairly good shot with small arms, show-thiinking but thorough, and very dirty in a clinch.&quot;&lt;P&gt; Mac gets into a jam this time even when he turns a job down. And all because of a book, an ex-gangster&#39;s patrician wife, and a red-headed cabaret doll. When all the blood is washed off and the smoke clears away, Mac has a murderer pinned down -- but he doesn&#39;t earn much more than a reputation as the most indestrictible man in the business.&lt;P&gt; &quot;Thomas B. Dewey is one of detective fiction&#39;s severely underrated writers!&quot; -- Bill Pronzini&lt;P&gt; &quot;Mac has been called one of the most believable and humane PI&#39;s in crime fiction. He is reluctant to use either his gun or his fists, but will do so when the situation demands it, or in self-defense; he doesn&#39;t merely solve his clients&#39; cases, but provides moral support and sympathy as well; and perhaps most notable of all, Mac feels, and is not afraid to show itópain, loss, sorrow, loneliness.&quot; --thrillingdetective.com" />

  <title>Blindfold Game - Dana Stabenow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Thailand, two men hire a pair of international pirates to smuggle them, a small team of mercenaries, and some equipment aboard a freighter at a Russian port. It&#39;s frighteningly easy, and the ship sails east, toward the western coast of North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew onboard the U.S. Coast Guard cutter &lt;i&gt;Sojourner Truth&lt;/i&gt;, stationed in the Bering Sea along the Maritime Boundary Line, is busier than usual, catching fishing vessels on the wrong side of the line, but it&#39;s not enough to cause undue alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, D.C., a CIA analyst has been hearing rumors about the sale of radioactive material and military equipment on the black market in deep Russia but can&#39;t get it confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst, Hugh Rincon, originally from Alaska and more keenly aware than most in Washington of Alaska&#39;s vulnerability with its air force base and proximity to the Far East, begins to piece it all together. He can&#39;t get anyone to take him seriously, however, least of all the director of the CIA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Hugh learns that his estranged wife, Sarah Lange, is second in command on the &lt;i&gt;Sojourner Truth&lt;/i&gt; in the Bering Sea at the heart of the potential conflict. And the chase is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stand-alone thriller from the pen of Dana Stabenow, Edgar Award--winning author of many crime novels, delivers a nail-biting, action-packed read in &lt;i&gt;Blindfold Game&lt;/i&gt;, international in scope and frighteningly real.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Trusting Appearances - Ned B. Ricks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Ricks gives us an &#39;Everyman&#39; who takes the reader on an intriguing life&#39;s ride full of action and mystery. All the while in the military thanks to a &#39;join the military or go to jail&#39; choice, on active duty in Vietnam, the States, or Reserve duty while a successful businessman, life-threatening danger follows just in the shadows.&quot;  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ross A. Rainwater&lt;/B&gt;, Lieutenant Colonel, Aviation, US Army (Ret) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Mrs. Blanchard,&quot; he started patiently, &quot;I am an officer in the US Army Reserves, and it&#39;s actually called Annual Training, not &#39;summer camp&#39; like the Boy Scouts.&quot;  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;You told me that you were in the &#39;real Army&#39;, weren&#39;t you?&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Yes, Mrs. Blanchard, I was. But that was a long time ago.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;And were you in the war, the Vietnam War?&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Uh huh. I went to Vietnam, ... twice.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She gestured at her own cheek mildly with the tips of her pale trembling fingers &quot;Wasn&#39;t that were you got the ... uh, oh my...&quot; her resolve ran out. &lt;/P
&lt;P&gt;Frank absently touched his face. He was able to put his fingers right on the line without looking. &quot;The scar?&quot; She nodded, apparently embarrassed now.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;No, Mrs. Blanchard, that was after.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>South of Nowhere - Minerva Koenig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reformed criminal Julia Kalas travels from small-town Texas to Mexico on the trail of a missing persons case in the second installment in this atmospheric, critically-acclaimed series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia Kalas has found a place for herself in small-town Texas. After being forced to relocate by the Aryan Brotherhood and witness protection, she&#39;s working on getting her budding construction business off the ground. But her newfound status as a sometimes-problem solver doesn&#39;t stop local cops from giving her the hairy eyeball when a dead body is found stuffed in the upstairs closet of her latest remodeling project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not up for another game of pin-the-tail-on-the-murder-suspect, Julia takes private detective John Maines up on an offer of employment working a missing persons case at the Texas-Mexico border. The fat check he dangles in front of her as payment will be enough to set her up in comfortable retirement far away from the tiny Texas backwater, which suits Julia just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, fate, as usual, has other plans for her. In South Texas, Julia learns that the dead man in her closet has been identified and that a warrant has been issued for her arrest. As she tangles with Mexican drug lords, shady surgeons, and a gang of Native American women with an axe to grind, she can&#39;t ignore the sinking feeling that things are about to get a hell of a lot worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;South of Nowhere&lt;/i&gt; is the action-packed follow up to Minerva Koenig&#39;s original and thrilling debut, featuring an intriguing mystery and a gutsy heroine mystery fans will love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

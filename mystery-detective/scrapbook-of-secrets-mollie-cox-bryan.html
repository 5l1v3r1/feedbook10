  <title>Scrapbook of Secrets - Mollie Cox Bryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having traded in her career as a successful investigative journalist for the life of a stay-at-home mom in picturesque Cumberland Creek, Virginia, Annie can&#39;t help but feel that something&#39;s missing. But she finds solace in a local &quot;crop circle&quot; of scrapbookers united by chore-shy husbands, demanding children, and occasional fantasies of their former single lives. And when the quiet idyll of their small town is shattered by a young mother&#39;s suicide, they band together to find out what went wrong.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie resurrects her reporting skills and discovers that Maggie Rae was a closet scrapbooker who left behind more than a few secrets--and perhaps a few enemies. As they sift through Maggie Rae&#39;s mysteriously discarded scrapbooks, Annie and her &quot;crop&quot; sisters begin to suspect that her suicide may have been murder. It seems that something sinister is lurking beneath the town&#39;s beguilingly calm fa&amp;#231;ade--like a killer with unfinished business.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A scrapbook of zany small town life with characters you&#39;ll want to visit again and again in each new novel.&quot; --Emilie Richards, author of &lt;i&gt;Sunset Bridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Imagine the housewives of Wisteria Lane sipping tea, scrapbooking, and solving murders, and you have this gem of a debut.&quot; --Lois Winston, author of &lt;i&gt;Assault with a Deadly Glue Gun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Intriguing characters, eerie happenings.  .  .kept me guessing &#39;til the end.&quot;  --Clare O&#39;Donohue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes tips and a glossary of terms for the modern scrapbooker!&lt;/b&gt;" />

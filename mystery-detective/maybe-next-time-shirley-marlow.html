  <title>Maybe Next Time - Shirley Marlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was June, another year of record breaking heat throughout the south when FBI agent, Dr. CC Cannon, returned to her home in New Orleans. For the past three years she had worked at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D. C. Her grandmother had called; her parents had died in an automobile accident. She needed to come home. Shortly after her arrival someone began sending CC notes and a mysterious caller was leaving her telephone messages suggesting it was murder. She kept them a secret. She was mystified, who would want the New Orleans Police Chief and his socialite wife dead and why? Was it an accident or was it murder?  Her friend and past employer, Special Agent Tom Pierce was instrumental in getting her reassigned to the New Orleans Bureau. She was determined to find the truth about her parents death, but quickly discovered it would not be easy. 
	Special Agent Marco Moretti is in New Orleans, on loan from the Miami Bureau. He is chasing after his long time nemesis Russian mobster, Ivan Milkovich.  Word has it he has been seen in New Orleans. To Moretti, even Milkovich has finally reached the bottom of the proverbial pit; trafficking and selling young, kidnapped Russian girls into slavery and prostitution in the U.S. 
	Will the death of Cannons parents and the actions of Ivan Milkovich be connected? The two team up with other agents from the New Orleans Bureau to search for the truth, but will their personal desires for each other hamper them in the investigation?" />

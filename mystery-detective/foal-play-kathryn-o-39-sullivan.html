  <title>Foal Play - Kathryn O&#39;Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Colleen McCabe is enjoying an uneventful summer in North Carolina&#39;s Outer Banks supervising her firefighters, making rounds with her Border collie, Sparky, and keeping an eye on the wild horses escaped from the local sanctuary. But when a dead body washes up on shore, she knows trouble has arrived in Corolla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleen is ready to start work on the investigation, but much to her irritation, her best friend, Sheriff Bill Dorman, makes it clear he doesn&#39;t want her butting her nose in or poking around. The stubborn Colleen, however, is not so easily deterred. When a man with a gun is spotted lurking around the lighthouse and her former school teacher&#39;s house explodes, she adds arson and a second suspicious death to her informal investigation.  Colleen soon finds herself juggling her job, amorous advances from the town&#39;s developer, and intrusions from the local press, all while keeping information from Bill. Her secret sleuthing quickly comes to an end, however, when a bigger threat enters the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a gutsy heroine, a lovable dog sidekick, quirky characters, and a charming locale, Kathryn O&#39;Sullivan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Foal Play&lt;/i&gt; is a zany, fun-filled ride sure to please mystery readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

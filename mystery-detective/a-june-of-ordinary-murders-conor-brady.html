  <title>A June of Ordinary Murders - Conor Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thrilling, beautifully written mystery debut that brings Victorian Dublin vividly, passionately to life, drawing readers on a gripping journey of murder and intrigue.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the 1880s the Dublin Metropolitan Police classified crime in two distinct categories. Political crimes were classed as &quot;special,&quot; whereas theft, robbery and even murder, no matter how terrible, were known as &quot;ordinary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dublin, June 1887: The city swelters in a long summer heat wave, the criminal underworld simmers, and with it, the threat of nationalist violence is growing.  Meanwhile, the Castle administration hopes the celebration of Queen Victoria&#39;s Golden Jubilee will pass peacefully.  Then, the mutilated bodies of a man and a child are discovered in Phoenix Park and Detective Sergeant Joe Swallow steps up to investigate. Cynical and tired, Swallow is a man living on past successes in need of a win. With the Land War at its height, the priority is to contain special crime, and these murders appear to be ordinary--and thus of lesser priority. But when the evidence suggests high-level involvement, and the body count increases, Swallow must navigate the treacherous waters of foolish superiors, political directives, and frayed tempers to solve the case, find the true murderer, and deliver justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Conor Brady, the former editor of &lt;i&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A June of Ordinary Murders&lt;/i&gt; is an accomplished, atmospheric debut that captures the life and essence of Dublin in the 1880s and introduces an unforgettable new sleuth.&lt;/p&gt;" />

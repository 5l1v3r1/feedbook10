  <title>Monsieur Pamplemousse Hits the Headlines - Michael Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time as an inspector with the Paris &lt;i&gt;S&amp;#251;ret&amp;#233;&lt;/i&gt; Monsieur Pamplemousse had been &amp;#145;in at the death&amp;#8217; on more than one occasion, but even he had to admit that the phrase took on an entirely new meaning when he was present at the spectacular ending to &lt;i&gt;Cuisine de Chavignol&lt;/i&gt;, France&amp;#8217;s premier television cookery programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in the front row of an invited studio audience, he watched in silent horror as the eponymous host, having downed an oyster in close-up, uttered a strangled cry and slowly but surely sank from view behind a kitchen worktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pommes Frites, sniffer dog extraordinaire, has his own views on the matter: Claude Chavignol was a bad egg if ever he&amp;#8217;d seen one. Subsequence events prove him right, and soon he and his master find themselves caught up in a bizarre world of unrequited lust, murder and blackmail in high places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colourful, comical and deliciously entertaining, it is no wonder that in this new adventure &lt;i&gt;Monsieur Pamplemousse Hits the Headlines&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

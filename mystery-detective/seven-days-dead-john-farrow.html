  <title>Seven Days Dead - John Farrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During an epic storm in the Gulf of Maine a lone woman races--first by car, then by a life-threatening sea crossing--to the island of Grand Manan. Her father is dying--will she make it in time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others also venture out into the maelstrom that night, including a mysterious band of men and women who gather on Seven Days Work, the sheer cliff that overlooks the wild sea. A housekeeper, a pastor, and a strange recluse are also wandering about out in the tempest. Who else risks being out in the turbulent black night? And how many murder victims will be revealed at the break of dawn? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such questions will engage retired Montreal detective Émile Cinq-Mars. He and his wife seek shelter from the same storm as they make their way to the island for a rare summer vacation from both his police work and her horse stable. With a mounting death toll, a lengthy list of suspects, and a murder in the deep past that somehow affects the present, Cinq-Mars is drawn into uncovering ancient secrets that have led to murder. When the villainy turns against him, another race ensues, this time to solve the crimes before his visit to the island ends in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Farrow&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Seven Days Dead&lt;/i&gt; continues the Émile Cinq-Mars series of crime novels, which &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; has called &quot;one of the best series in crime fiction,&quot;; Die Zeit in Germany has suggested it might be the best of all time.&lt;/p&gt;" />

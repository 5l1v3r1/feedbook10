At Moe&#39;s request, Saikawa showed his treasured photograph to others. It was taken when late Dr. Kyosuke Nishinosono, Saikawa&#39;s mentor and Moe&#39;s father, visited India for research. Saikawa challenged others to solve the mystery pertaining to what was in the photograph.  &quot;The finial, which was supposed to be placed on top of the pagoda, was made separately, attached to the ground nearby.&quot;  During the heated debate, the party attenders presented their own versions of reasoning to solve the mystery regarding the peculiarity of &#39;Five Ratha&#39;. What shocking truth behind the mystery would they discover?  This is the first English version of the story from &#39;S&amp;M (Saikawa &amp; Moe) Series&#39;, one of the most coveted mystery fiction series in Japan." />

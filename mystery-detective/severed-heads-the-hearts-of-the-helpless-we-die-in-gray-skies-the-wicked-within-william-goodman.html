It flows seamlessly with captivating imagery and creative word play. Each story is dark and heavy and covers a wide range of topics like: addiction, depression, vanity, sexual abuse, religion, and revenge. William has been crafting a unique writing style. His love for lyrical hip-hop has lead him to create a genre he calls, &quot;rhyme story&quot;. Meaning, it&#39;s lush like poetry, but has the technique of any skilled lyricists." />

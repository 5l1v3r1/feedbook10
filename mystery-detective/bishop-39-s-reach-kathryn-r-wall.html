  <title>Bishop&#39;s Reach - Kathryn R. Wall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bleached-blond call girls rarely bring good news, especially the one who bursts through the door of Bay Tanner&#39;s struggling inquiry agency and into her already complicated life. Karen Zwilling swears she&#39;s been viciously attacked but can&#39;t--or won&#39;t--go to the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tragedy of her husband&#39;s murder finally resolved, Bay has been yearning for a little tranquillity, but that hope is shattered, both by Karen&#39;s plea for help and by the unexpected reappearance of aging playboy Win Hammond, scion of an old Beaufort family, who has been missing for more than twenty years. Why has the prodigal son chosen this moment to return, and what will the consequences be for his sister, Bay&#39;s beloved Miss Addie? Add to all this a suspected embezzlement by a local businessman and his questionable relationship with his partner, and suddenly Bay and her young associate, Erik Whiteside, find themselves hip-deep in cases and clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a disfigured corpse is discovered on the beach at Hilton Head, Bay&#39;s longed-for peace and quiet are irrevocably washed away on the outgoing tide, and suddenly it&#39;s clear that no one is who they appear to be, including Bay&#39;s former nemesis Ben Wyler. As the pieces finally tumble into place, the shocking resolution may prove as deadly for Bay Tanner as the treacherous waters of Bishop&#39;s Reach.&lt;/p&gt;" />

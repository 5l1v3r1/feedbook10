  <title>Unfinished Flight - Ken Filing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the late 1930s, Rosie Conner is a young female daredevil pilot, and her hero is the famous pilot Amelia Earhart. Several years after Earhart disappears during a flight across the Pacific, Rosie and her husband Chris try to complete her unfinished flight. Unfortunately, they find themselves recreating the journey too accurately, as they also crash into the Pacific. They are eventually rescued by the crew of a Japanese ship; however, it is only after they have boarded the ship that they realize they are not guests but prisoners. The year is 1941, and they are treated brutally in the months leading up to the infamous battle at Pearl Harbor. 
As Rosie and Chris deal with peril and adventure on an island occupied by the Japanese, World War II becomes a larger threat to the world. Follow the adventure of a lifetime, and see the world through the eyes of a pilot whose bravery knows no bounds, who lives a life of adventure and risk-taking." />

  <title>Downfall - Samuel E. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This story is about standing up and fighting for what you believe in, even if its against those controlling your local government. The intent of the author is to entertain the reader while stimulating the realization of the actual threats of local government when people in positions of authority act in their own self interest without having to be accountable for their actions. In a Democratic Society each and every one of us have the responsibility to stand up and confront those actions of our elected officials that undermine our CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS and FREEDOMS.  Only by holding those in power accountable can we truly maintain AMERICAS BIRTH RIGHT. &lt;P&gt;	Follow the Sarge as he stands up to injustice and pays the price as the good ole boy system of leadership first attempts to destroy him, but when that fails, they resort to a more deadly approach which leaves the Sarge in a battle for mere survival. The action is non-stop from the playing field to the court room as the excitement builds in a never ending battle of wits and determination. WARNING...Downfall will make you angry. It will make you cry. It will enhance your outlook and make you look twice at those you elect to political office.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>Southern Poison - T. Lynn Ocean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last time Jersey Barnes tried to quit her career as a security specialist and leave home without a weapon, she ended up in the middle of a high-stakes cover-up and a scheme to steal millions from hardworking Americans. This time her early retirement is for real. Friends threw her a party to prove it. There was a cake and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But out of the blue, her former handler shows up with other ideas. When Jersey tells him she doesn&#39;t want an assignment---even if does come with an upfront hazard-pay bonus---he reminds her of a clause in the contract she signed back when she was first recruited to work for the government: a pesky paragraph that says she can be recalled into service at&lt;i&gt; any &lt;/i&gt;time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With boating and golfing plans on hold yet again, Jersey straps on her weapon of choice and goes undercover to help root out a terrorist threat---only to learn that another more sinister plot is in the works. And things aren&#39;t any more relaxing at home, either. Just as she starts to explore a steamy relationship with her hunky pub manager, Ox, his ex-wife flies in from California to reclaim him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Southern Poison&lt;/i&gt; moves at breakneck speed as Jersey must save herself from an assassin, stop an evil chemist, keep her troublemaking father and his poker buddies out of jail, untangle a steamy romance, and maybe---just maybe---retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the heels of the lauded&lt;i&gt; Southern Fatality,&lt;/i&gt; readers will welcome another hilarious, suspenseful, and sun-soaked adventure from the unforgettable Jersey Barnes.&lt;/p&gt;" />

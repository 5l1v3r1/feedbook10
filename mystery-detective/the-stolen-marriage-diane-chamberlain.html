  <title>The Stolen Marriage - Diane Chamberlain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steeped in history and filled with heart-wrenching twists, &lt;i&gt;The Stolen Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is an emotionally captivating novel of secrets, betrayals, prejudice, and forgiveness.  It showcases Diane Chamberlain at the top of her talent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;One mistake, one fateful night, and Tess DeMello&#39;s life is changed forever. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is 1944. Pregnant, alone, and riddled with guilt, twenty-three-year-old Tess DeMello abruptly gives up her budding career as a nurse and ends her engagement to the love of her life, unable to live a lie. Instead, she turns to the baby&#39;s father for help and agrees to marry him, moving to the small, rural town of Hickory, North Carolina. Tess&#39;s new husband, Henry Kraft, is a secretive man who often stays out all night, hides money from his new wife, and shows her no affection. Tess quickly realizes she&#39;s trapped in a strange and loveless marriage with no way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Hickory love and respect Henry but see Tess as an outsider, treating her with suspicion and disdain. When one of the town&#39;s golden girls dies in a terrible accident, everyone holds Tess responsible.  But Henry keeps his secrets even closer now, though it seems that everyone knows something about him that Tess does not.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a sudden polio epidemic strikes Hickory, the townspeople band together to build a polio hospital. Tess knows she is needed and defies Henry&#39;s wishes to begin working at there. Through this work, she begins to find purpose and meaning. Yet at home, Henry&#39;s actions grow more alarming by the day. As Tess works to save the lives of her patients, can she untangle the truth behind her husband&#39;s mysterious behavior and find the love--and the life--she was meant to have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Library Reads Top Ten Book of October 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Stolen Marriage:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[A] &lt;b&gt;well-crafted&lt;/b&gt; crime-tinged tale.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The Stolen Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;b&gt;the kind of story that will grab you and refuse to let you go&lt;/b&gt; until you turn the last page.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;All About Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Readers will be sucked in immediately...&lt;b&gt;you just can&#39;t go wrong&lt;/b&gt; with a book with [Chamberlain&#39;s] name on the cover.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Southern Pines Pilot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

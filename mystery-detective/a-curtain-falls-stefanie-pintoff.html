  <title>A Curtain Falls - Stefanie Pintoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The careers of New York City detective Simon Ziele and his former partner Captain Declan Mulvaney went in remarkably different directions after the tragic death of Ziele&#39;s fiancée in the 1904 General Slocum ferry disaster. Although both men were earmarked for much bigger things, Ziele moved to Dobson, a small town north of the city, to escape the violence, and Mulvaney buried himself even deeper, agreeing to head up the precinct in the most crime-ridden area in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with all of the detectives and resources at Mulvaney&#39;s disposal, a particularly puzzling crime compels him to look for someone he can trust absolutely.  When a chorus girl is found dead on a Broadway stage dressed in the leading lady&#39;s costume, there are no signs of violence, no cuts, no bruises--no marks at all. If pressed, the coroner would call it a suicide, but then that would make her the second girl to turn up dead in such a manner in the last few weeks.  And the news of a possible serial killer would be potentially disastrous to the burgeoning theater world, not to mention the citizens of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on the heels of Stefanie Pintoff&#39;s acclaimed and award-winning debut, &lt;i&gt;A Curtain Falls&lt;/i&gt; is a moody and evocative tale that follows Ziele and his partners as they scour the dark streets of early-twentieth-century New York in search of a true fiend.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Russian - Noel Hynd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A thrilling compilation of three complete novels from bestselling author Noel Hynd&#39;s Russian Trilogy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracy in Kiev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrewd investigator and an expert marksman, Special Agent Alexandra LaDuca can handle any case the FBI gives her. Or can she? While on loan from the US Department of the Treasury, Alex is tapped to accompany a Secret Service team during an American Presidential visit to Ukraine. Her assignment: to keep personal watch over Yuri Federov, the most charming and most notorious gangster in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight in Madrid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mysterious relic is stolen from a Madrid museum, people are dying to discover its secrets. Literally. US Treasury agent Alexandra LaDuca returns to track down the stolen artwork, a small carving called The Piet&amp;agrave; of Malta. It seems to be a simple assignment, but nothing about this job is simple, as the mysteries and legends surrounding the relic become increasingly complex with claims of supernatural power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Countdown in Cairo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal agent Alexandra LaDuca travels to Egypt to investigate the possible sighting of a former mentor, a CIA agent whom everyone thought was dead. She is thrown into the deadliest game of double cross of her career as the events that began in Kiev and continued in Madrid find their culmination in the volatile Middle East. Her assignment is to locate a man she once knew. But to find the answers, Alex needs to move quickly into the underworld of the Egyptian capital, a nether society of crooks, killers, spies, and Islamic fundamentalists.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Apollo must go into hiding in the &amp;ldquo;wild territories&amp;rdquo; of Uor, and Ares tries to draw him out by giving his support, and the Gardener he controls, to The Seven Great Families, a group of very dangerous extremist on Earth, who wish to replicate The Seven Great Families of Uor, where 30,000 years of rule by the &amp;ldquo;Families&amp;rdquo; has produced a regimented political, social, and economic structure that rewards the few who are born to nobility at the expense of the great majority. Now, Apollo seeks to end the rule of the Noblers and bring democracy &amp;mdash; and the chaos that goes with it &amp;mdash; to his world.

  <title>A Murder in Mundelein - Mike Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our father is gone. And as for Monica, if she is out there somewhere, I can only imagine how she must have been haunted all along, maybe even daily, by all of this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin and I, I dont believe either of us has any burning desire to find Monica and bring her to justice. Deep down, I guess I think that she probably has served her life sentence for her crimes several times over  mental anguish that may have grown even beyond what I might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Benjamin and I just plan to move on, to continue our lives as we have been living them. We will try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for both of us, of course. But for me, the greatest difficulty will be learning to live with the legacy of my father. As I look back, I fear, it may be a diminished legacy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Its always difficult when you first realize that someone you idolize might be mortal after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am haunted by my father.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Exploits of Danby Croker - R. Austin Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if your doppelganger were committing crimes and making the police believe you were the perpetrator? In Danby Croker’s case, he decides to retaliate! But that is only one of the problems besetting him in this set of interlinked stories. Given a job as an antique dealer, can he resist the temptations of earning some easy money through a bit of fencing and counterfeiting? And what on earth is he doing going round London dressed as a suffragette?! R. Austin Freeman’s „The Exploits of Danby Croker” involves mistaken identities, art forgery, antique swindles, and even a little cross-dressing. There is a price to be paid for breaking the law, but who’s going to pay it? Originally written in 1911 by the great author of detective stories R. Austin Freeman, this is a comic novel that may surprise those who know Freeman’s work only through the „Dr. Thorndyke” stories! This rare collection of stories is an enjoyable romp through crime and romance." />

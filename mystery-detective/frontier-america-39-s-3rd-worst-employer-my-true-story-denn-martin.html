      <meta name="description" content="Please Everyone that has FRONTIER! I think would want to read this book.  It&#39;s my first and not to be my last. I wish to inform all of what first hand Corporate abuse of workers and the pandering of the Unions that were supposed to work for the worker not the other way around. I hope for the small fee you mite also bye a copy for your ebook or kindle. To read the unbelievable nine years of it and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s all true. Read about at few of many Supervisor out for themselves and the law. I&#39;m calling for a class action Lawyer to take a real look in these pages and see what else is coming soon. There is a case here and I hope my book will get someone off their tail ends and do the right thing! This is not someone that just putting this out there for the fun of it. No! I wish for the same as I got for them to be held in account for their actions. The Corporate heads don&#39;t care as long as the MILLIONS keep rolling in. Even if it is mostly STOLEN from CUSTOMERS!  Thanks,Your tech friend,Dennis aka/Denn Martin" />

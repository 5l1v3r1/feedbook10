  <title>The Jericho Flower - Stephen F. Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Returning for his fourth misadventure, small-town newspaperman and social gadfly Elias Hackshaw finds himself immersed in a mystery involving a dead con man and a missing gypsy princess with the improbable name of Bimbo Wanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through no fault of his ownwell, almost noneHack becomes a suspect in the case when the cops mistakenly conclude that he was an acquaintance of the murdered con artist. Meanwhile, Bimbo&#39;s parents turn up on Hack&#39;s doorstep demanding he turn over their missing daughter, or face a gypsy curse. To add to the mayhem, a local industrialist is badgering Hackshaw to oversee a major renovation to his monstrosity of a house, and Hack&#39;s sister Ruth is hectoring him to forget everything else and see to his duties as editor of &lt;i&gt;The Triton Advertiser&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trapped by circumstance, Hack begins poking into things and soon discovers a circus assortment of off-beat characters: gypsies in cowboy hats, a con man with a conscience, a sheriff&#39;s investigator without a heartor a brainham-fisted townies, and much, much more. Only a strong survival instinct, and his usual portion of dumb luck, can save Hackshaw this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilcox spins an entertaining yarn of murder and mayhemWith a credible plot and eccentric characters that adroitly avoid being mere caricatures, Wilcox offers a semi-cozy mysteryuncloying, clever and far from brutal.&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilcox is an absolutely first-rate writer&lt;I&gt;The Jericho Flower&lt;/I&gt; is a well-crafted, imaginative tale that this reader wished could go on for much longer. It&#39;s a great read&lt;I&gt;Midwest Book Review&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Jericho Flower&lt;/I&gt; is a surprising, deep, amusing, and character driven mystery that will keep you on your toesIt&#39;s a mystery that keeps you hanging until the very end, an unlikely hero who will keep you laughing, and a full range of characters that opens you up to small town lifea most involved and amusing mystery from this very talented author.&lt;I&gt;All About Murder&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

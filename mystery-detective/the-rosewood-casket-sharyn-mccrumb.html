  <title>The Rosewood Casket - Sharyn Mccrumb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eloquent, lyrical, and richly textured . . . There is no one quite like [McCrumb] among present-day writers. No one better either.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a career spanning decades, and superlatives from reviewers nationwide--whose bestselling novels have been named Notable Books by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;LA Times&lt;/i&gt;--this is one of Sharyn McCrumb&#39;s most cherished novels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage is set for family drama when Randall Stargill lies dying on his southern Appalachian farm, and his four sons come home to build him a coffin made from the special cache of rosewood he has saved for this purpose.  Meanwhile, mountain wisewoman, Nora Bonesteel, prepares another box--to be buried with him.  Among them, a real estate developer is hovering over the family&#39;s farm bringing secrets and tensions to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a style both lyrical and beautifully detailed, with a narrative that flows from Native American lore and the burnished tales of Daniel Boone--up to the sharpest, and keenly realized landscapes of Appalachia today, &lt;i&gt;The Rosewood Casket&lt;/i&gt; is a novel as hauntingly beautiful as the mountains that gave it charge--and a stunning addition to our collection of McCrumb Ballad novels.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Corrupted - Lisa Scottoline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bennie Rosato the founder of the Rosato &amp; DiNunzio law firm hides her big heart beneath her tough-as-nails exterior and she doesn&#39;t like to fail. Now, a case from her past shows her how differently things might have turned out in Lisa Scottoline&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Corrupted&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years ago, Bennie Rosato took on Jason Lefkavick, a twelve-year-old boy who was sent to a juvenile detention center after fighting a class bully. Bennie couldn&#39;t free Jason, and to this day it&#39;s the case that haunts her. Jason has grown up in and out of juvenile prison, and his adulthood hasn&#39;t been any easier. Bennie no longer represents those accused of murder,  but when Jason is indicted for killing the same bully he fought with as a kid, she sees no choice but to represent him. She doesn&#39;t know whether or not to believe his claims of innocence, but she knows she owes him for past failures-of the law, of the juvenile justice system, and of herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to relive the darkest period of her life, Bennie will do everything in her power to get the truth, and justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />

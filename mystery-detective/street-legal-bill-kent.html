  <title>Street Legal - Bill Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Andy Cosicki is summoned to the boss&#39;s office to describe the murder she discovered, she finds a police lieutenant and Michael McSloan, the paper&#39;s lawyer, waiting to hear her story. It requires some effort to not be distracted by McSloan&#39;s good looks, even though the scene was unforgettable--attorney Charles Muckler had been trapped in his car while a truckload of wet sand was pumped into it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good looks are not always matched with good character, however, and it doesn&#39;t take Andy long to see beyond McSloan&#39;s gorgeous profile. She isn&#39;t all that surprised when his body is found at the foot of his high-rise apartment building. He definitely didn&#39;t jump; the only question is, which of his many enemies was the one to do the pushing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trying to put two and two together, Andy gets caught up with her concern for McSloan&#39;s disabled young son and for another boy, who wrote to her &quot;Mr. Action&quot; column for help. It takes knowledgeable obituary writer Shep Ladderback to point her down the right path. The oddly matched but delightful pair is just the team to track down a killer with a serious distaste for lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his fourth &quot;Street&quot; mystery, Bill Kent couples his knowledge as a journalist with the skills of a top-notch writer to build a world and a story that captivates the reader.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="Looking for the perfect cozy mystery to read tonight? In Queer and Cozy Mysteries, you&amp;rsquo;ll be treated to THREE tales of blackmail and murder featuring amusing incidents, hilarious dialogue and LGBT characters!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In MURDER AT THE OFFICE, Sharon and her teenage daughter haven&amp;rsquo;t been on the best of terms since the divorce. When Kate shows up at the office, the only thing that could surprise Sharon more is finding the boss strangled to death! Can mother and daughter put their squabbles aside long enough to solve a murder? Or will the killer strike again&amp;hellip; closer to home?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the inimitable Miss Agatha Vanderjagt receives a blackmail letter alongside copies of scandalous photographs from her youth, trans guy Chris is the only person she can turn to for help.

&lt;br /&gt;
In THE TURKEY WORE SATIN, Thanksgiving at Mayfair Manor is an elegant affair: polished silver, sparkling crystal, not to mention the Amazing Annual Mayfair Family Drag Show!&amp;nbsp; But when the perennial winner drops dead before the performance, can the newest member of the Mayfair family prove it was murder&amp;hellip; and figure out whodunit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>Murder with a Twist - Allyson K.  Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The regulars at Mack&#39;s Bar love putting their heads together to solve a good mystery. But Mack is learning there&#39;s a big difference between barroom brain teasers and real-life murder.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Milwaukee bar owner Mackenzie &quot;Mack&quot; Dalton has a unique neurological condition that gives her extra perceptive senses, and police detective Duncan Albright is convinced Mack&#39;s abilities can be used to help catch crooks. Mack may be at pro at mixing drinks, but she&#39;s still an amateur when it comes to solving crimes--and she&#39;s not sure she should mix business with pleasure by working with a man who stirs up such strong feelings in her. At her first crime scene--a suspicious suicide--she experiences a heady cocktail of mixed sensations and emotions that make her question whether police work is right for her. But when Duncan asks her to help find a kidnapped child, she knows she has to give it a shot.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The first book in the Mack&#39;s Bar Mystery series is a hit!&quot; --&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Murder on the Rocks &lt;/i&gt;" />

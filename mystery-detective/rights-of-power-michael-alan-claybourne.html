  <title>Rights of Power - Michael Alan Claybourne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three years ago star Sheriffs Deputy Wesley Cobin was accused of murdering his partner. The evidence against him was conclusive. Instead of serving out a life sentence, however, he used a crack legal team to slip out of the charges. Now, he lives the life of an outcast.
Shaken by Cobins betrayal of trust, Sheriff Fineas Tully spends his days trying to forget the past as he watches his former ace detective heading into a self-destructive tailspin.
 Then they find the body.
 The suspicions of the townsfolks and Tullys Deputies, naturally turn to the one man in town who already slipped through the hands of justice.
 While initially unconvinced of Cobins guilt, when the next body turns out to be the reporter who covered the controversial trial, is there a better suspect?
 Tully must race to uncover the truth before the townsfolk, or Cobin, can do any more damage, while trying to sort out all of the emotions connected to the boy he once mentored. Meanwhile Cobin makes it his goal to stay one step ahead of Tully in his own parallel investigation, but is the truth really what hes searching for?
 Things begin to spiral ever more out of control when the past, and Cobins homicidal father, are dragged into the mix. As the body count rises Tully begins to wonder if there is anyone left that he can trust to weigh the evidence, before the case is ripped from his hands.
 How many bodies will it take for the real motive to be puzzled out, will Cobin pay for his rights of power, and will Tullys own daughter be one of the next victims?" />

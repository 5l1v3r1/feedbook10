  <title>Firsen&#39;s America - James Vincent Kulis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was tired of looking over my shoulder and tired watching what I said. I was tired of running and hiding. It sounded dramatic---lure a sitting United States president to a small African country. Little did Firsen and I know, that would be just the start of it. Again, I hesitate to write down any of what Firsen and I did. That was, after all, how Goliath found us in the first placemy writings. But the rule of law has broken down and, if anyone is looking for criminals, they are looking for bigger ones than Firsen and me. I guess you need to check with General David Goliath, the richest and the strongest man on Earth. This was really his caper. We were just along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

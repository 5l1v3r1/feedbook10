  <title>Death, Taxes, and Green Tea Ice Cream - Diane Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fired&lt;/i&gt;. Tara Holloway can&#39;t believe it. After all she&#39;s done for the IRS, a few too many shots fired from her weapon and suddenly she&#39;s public enemy number one. To add insult to injury, another agent has replaced her, and a ten-million-dollar assault case is hanging over her head. So much for traveling to Tokyo with Special Agent Nick Pratt, former partner and current boyfriend. Tara&#39;s stuck in Texas, and using green tea ice cream to soothe her disappointment, as well as the terrifying prospect of a life behind bars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tara&#39;s former boss, Lu &quot;the Lobo&quot; Lobozinski, has a plan--to stick Tara in auditing, where she can&#39;t possibly get into trouble. But between bumping into a college frenemy whose family business is under audit, Tara&#39;s stubborn determination to keep an eye on Nick behind the scenes, and her new long-range rifle, she&#39;s about to get a taste of just how dangerous her life can be, in &lt;i&gt;Death, Taxes, and Green Tea Ice Cream &lt;/i&gt;from Diane Kelly...&lt;/p&gt;" />

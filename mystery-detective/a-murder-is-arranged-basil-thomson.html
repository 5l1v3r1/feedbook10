  <title>A Murder is Arranged - Basil Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;None of the other guests could explain what she was doing in Crooked Lane during the night…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Margaret Gask, guest at Scudamore Hall, was shot to death on the driveway of the estate. The mink coat that she &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; have been wearing turned out to be the first clue Scotland Yard had to work on. Then a man she knew, a receiver of stolen goods, turns up dead. Soon more shady characters are drawn into the story: receivers, jewel thieves, confidence men and convicted felons on both sides of the Channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richardson, now Chief Constable, orchestrates the clues concerning a murdered French senator, the theft of a famous emerald, a fake Italian prince and a mysterious priest who sought sanctuary after perpetrating thefts and felonies all over France. The case ends back in Scudamore Hall, where an ecclesiastical robe replaces a mink coat as Exhibit A.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last and arguably most entertaining of all the Richardson novels, &lt;i&gt;A Murder is Arranged&lt;/i&gt; (1937) has action, humour and a brilliant cast of major and minor characters. This new edition, the first in many decades, includes a new introduction by crime novelist Martin Edwards, author of acclaimed genre history &lt;i&gt;The Golden Age of Murder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Few authors can claim such an intimate knowledge of Scotland Yard and criminals as Sir Basil Thomson, one-time Assistant Commissioner at the Yard. He provides subtle intrigue, clever deduction, and bright dialogue.” &lt;i&gt;Referee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

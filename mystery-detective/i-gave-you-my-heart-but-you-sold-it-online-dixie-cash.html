  <title>I Gave You My Heart, but You Sold It Online - Dixie Cash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To single mom Allison Barker, men are a heap of heartbreak. So when her twelve-year-old daughter confesses that she&#39;s posted Allison&#39;s profile on an Internet matchmaking service &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has been pretending to be her mom, Allison hits the roof . . . just before the doorbell rings. Standing on the porch is her date&amp;#8212;he&#39;s Hollywood handsome and all male and he looks somehow familiar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out he&#39;s famed ProRodeo bull-riding champion Quint Matthews. He whisks Allison off to dinner, but it&#39;s not Quint who captures her interest&amp;#8212;it&#39;s his old friend, rodeo bull fighter Tag Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Quint&#39;s got something&amp;#8212;or rather, someone, more on his mind than Allison&amp;#8212;because the very next day he&#39;s off to visit Debbie Sue Overstreet. Debbie Sue was once taken in by Quint&#39;s sky-blue eyes and tight jeans, but that was before she &lt;em&gt;remarried&lt;/em&gt; the best-looking man in Texas, Buddy Overstreet. When Quint turns up at Debbie Sue&#39;s door begging for help, she can&#39;t turn him down. Seems that Quint has finally gotten his comeuppance&amp;#8212;his identity has been stolen, by a &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; no less, one he met through an online dating service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Equalizers take the case&amp;#8212;after all, Quint is an &quot;old friend&quot; and, even better, he can pay! But no one would ever have guessed that the investigation would lead to murder . . . or that gender-confused Eugene/Janine&amp;#8212;whom the Equalizers have tangled with before&amp;#8212;would return to stir the stew. Or that there would be mixed messages and broken hearts all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as Edwina has often said, there&#39;s nothin&#39; that a pitcher of strong margaritas and some serious snooping can&#39;t cure . . . but not until Debbie Sue and Edwina go on a crazy ride across West Texas!&lt;/p&gt;" />

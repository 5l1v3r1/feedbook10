      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE NEW TWISTY, GRIPPING READ FROM B. A. PARIS, THE AUTHOR OF THE INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; AND &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLING NOVELS &lt;i&gt;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS &lt;/i&gt;AND &lt;i&gt;THE BREAKDOWN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#39;re in a new Golden Age of suspense writing now, because of amazing books like &lt;i&gt;Bring Me Back&lt;/i&gt;, and I for one am loving it.&quot; --Lee Child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[An] outstanding Hitchcockian thriller.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She went missing. He moved on. A whole world of secrets remained--until now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They&#39;re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone--never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla&#39;s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there&#39;s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla--hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla&#39;s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen&#39;s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive--and on Finn&#39;s trail--what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, &lt;i&gt;Bring Me Back&lt;/i&gt; will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Heart of Stone - Girad Clacy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Global climatic changes during the early part of the 21st century have placed enormous demands on fossil fuels. Global warming has altered the once predictable weather patterns for the whole planet. The largest shifts in weather have put the United States, in the year 2004, at risk of freezing to death if something isnt done about the problem. Fossil fuels have been in the final stages of exhaustion for some time, however with the shifting weather patterns, this demand has become an unquenchable thirst. Even in late 1999 as his Presidency was ending, Bill Clintons gesture to open up the oil reserves was to no avail. The Exxon Company, one of the only oil companies left after the stock market Crash of 2000, reported that they have built two huge ships to bring back large quantities of natural gas to the United States from overseas. Will the United States freeze to death? Find out in Girad Clacys finest techno-thriller. Liquefied natural gas is both unseen and highly explosive in its pure state and the CORAZON DE PIEDRA, on her maiden voyage is filled full. Walk up the gangplank of a ship carrying 750,000 cubic feet of LNG.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Scarweather - Anthony Rolls, Martin Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With an introduction by martin edwards  &#39;My friend Ellingham has persuaded me to reveal to the public the astounding features of the Reisby case. As a study in criminal aberration it is, he tells me, of particular interest, while in singularity of horror and in perversity of ingenious method it is probably unique.&#39;  1913. John Farringdale, with his cousin Eric Foster, visits the famous archaeologist Tolgen Reisby. At Scarweather - Reisby&#39;s lonely house on the windswept northern coast of England - Eric is quickly attracted to Reisby&#39;s much younger wife, and matters soon take a dangerous turn. Fifteen years later, the final scene of the drama is enacted.  This unorthodox novel from 1934 is by a gifted crime writer who, wrote Dorothy L. Sayers, &#39;handles his characters like a &quot;real&quot; novelist and the English language like a &quot;real&quot; writer - merits which are still, unhappily, rarer than they should be in the ranks of the murder specialists.&#39;" />

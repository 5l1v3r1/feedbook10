  <title>The Longest Shadow - R.J. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DETECTIVE Sergeant Gus Thoroughgood is back on the streets of Glasgow in The Longest Shadow. Beginning on top of Scotland&#39;s iconic Wallace Monument, when a skeleton from Thoroughgood&#39;s past threatens to put the full stop on his future, the action comes at the reader like a runaway train. In the third instalment of RJ Mitchell&#39;s gritty Glaswegian crime thriller series, Thoroughgood finds himself in pursuit of a suspect he believes is the psychopathic leader of a vicious gang wanted for murder and abduction. The streets of Glasgow&#39;s West End and city centre are the location for a high octane pursuit that leaves the reader gasping for breath, before culminating in a life and death struggle on top of one of Glasgow&#39;s most famous landmarks, the Rennie Mackintosh designed Glasgow school of Art - but does Thoroughgood have the right man? Just as he defies death to thwart the gang, Thoroughgood&#39;s complicated love life ensnares him in the battle for control of the Roxburgh Whisky dynasty. Tension builds towards a nail-biting crescendo as the DS attempts to identify the cold-blooded killer who is intent on wiping out the nation&#39;s most famous whisky family. While the finger of guilt, in an apparently haphazard investigation, is being pointed at a powerful Triad leader, clues from a 70 year-old war time diary lead the DS to realise nothing is as it seems. But with his growing feelings for Victoria Roxburgh, the last of the Dynasty&#39;s surviving siblings, clouding his judgement, Thoroughgood finds himself in a fight to the end with a ruthless foe whose identity shocks them both. Third in the Detective Thoroughgood Series following &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; and &quot;The Hurting&quot;" />

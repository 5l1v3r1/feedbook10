&lt;em&gt;a Mecana Novel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;John L. Lansdale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this horrific detective tale, someone is leaving murdered and mutilated bodies in a Dallas suburb, using the same techniques found in a Houston crime scene the previous year.&lt;br /&gt;
When another body is found in Dallas, it seems certain the killer has moved hunting grounds.&lt;br /&gt;
As the body count rises, Detective Thomas Mecana is assigned to the case.&lt;br /&gt;
A fifteen-year veteran of the Dallas Police Department, Mecana prides himself on always getting his man...but his tried-and-true methods of the past seem to no longer be working.&lt;br /&gt;
To make matters worse, his supervisor assigns him a new partner - Darcie Connors, a young officer working her first murder case.&lt;br /&gt;
Add in one ex-wife and two teenage daughters creating problems at home, and a boss threatening to fire him at work, and Mecana&amp;#39;s life begins to unravel as he hones in on his suspect.&lt;br /&gt;
With hard work, and some luck, Mecana and his partner discover a most-unusual serial killer case with murder in its very genes.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, they discover some evidence is so strange and unbelievable, it might be best left alone.&lt;br /&gt;

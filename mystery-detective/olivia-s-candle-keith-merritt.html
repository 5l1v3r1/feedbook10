  <title>Olivia’S Candle - Keith Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Holy Land, Christianitys most stunning find in over two millennia bursts into the news and reaches into every corner of the world. Three newly discovered gospels, exhaustively vetted by theologians, testify to the life, ministry, and death of Jesus of Nazareth. They reveal conclusive evidence that the evangelists who wrote them were women! Faced with the undeniable truth that Jesus of Nazareth selected women to accompany him as his disciples, the Vatican opens the doors of the priesthood to women.
From the raucous alleys of New Orleans, one homeless young girlOlivia Couviersurvives a close brush with her own death, grows to womanhood, and forges a fresh trail through the ranks of the Catholic Churchs hierarchy. In time, she arrives at the pinnacle of power, the papacy itself.
Throughout her journey, she clings to a dark secret, which if discovered, could cost her everything. Enemies emerge from within the churchs hierarchymen who will stop at nothing to snuff out the flame of Olivias candle that burns so brightly with hope!
From the bowels of New Orleans, to New England, to Venice, and to the gates of St. Peters Basilica, a race against time full of intrigue, danger, and suspensefaces Olivia. From the first page of Olivias Candle, youll be pulled in by the sheer magnitude of the story. Until you reach the final page, you wont be able to put down the book. Come! Follow the flame of Olivias adventures as she reaches for the impossible." />

  <title>The Cellar Incident - Lee Bruno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Marge never believed in in the existence of pure evil. Certainly, she placed no credence in the idea of supernatural evil, such as powerful spirits or entities from elsewhere that are capable of entering our material realm and committing horrific acts. Such fanciful notions were not part of her worldview. As Marge saw it, we already had enough vicious, hyper greedy and power hungry people in our real world, including any number of natural calamities  that was enough to deal with. Who wanted to be concerned about being beset by evil imports from some netherworld?  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One evening in early October, Marge and four of her friends, all college seniors, set off to look through an old, vacant farmhouse as a possible site for their Halloween party. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the three young men are examining the second floor of the house, they are interrupted by the hysterical calling out to them by one of the two young female companions. She insists, rather incoherently, that something awful has happened in the cellar. She seems to think what happened was caused by some kind of fantastic, monstrous thing, which suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Of course, her friends assume she is mistaken. As the group, all go to check out the cellar, they attempt to calm her by suggesting explanations that are more logical. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Marge, the other female member of this group, is also aware that something very extraordinary did happen, and she too is shaken to the core. However, she remains silent about what she experienced. Why? When put on the spot, she draws a blank. She cant think how to explain what she saw, heard and felt, without revealing the too humiliating truth of how she knows this: because she was eavesdropping at the cellar door. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Had she not eavesdropped, Marge realizes she could have remained blithely unaware of the cellar incident, which is by far, what she would have preferred. She will later desperately look for logical, rational explanations for what seemed to have happened in that cellar.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, she will find further evidence that will only support what Marge didnt want to believe. Indeed, that house is host to some evil alien thing that doesnt belong in this world.
The Cellar Incident will shatter Marges unquestioned concepts of what constitutes reality. The experience will haunt her dreams, torment her thoughts and force her to rethink her views on everything. &lt;/P&gt;" />

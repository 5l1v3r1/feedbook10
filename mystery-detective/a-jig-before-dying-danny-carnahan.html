  <title>A Jig Before Dying - Danny Carnahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writer and musician Danny Carnahan lives in Albany, California with his wife Saundra.  His published writing includes Irish Songs For Guitar (2004, Hal Leonard) and true stories for Travelers Tales.  Dannys feature articles have appeared in The San Francisco Chronicle and in eclectic music magazines including Acoustic Guitar and Mandolin Magazine.  
Danny is most widely known as a musician and songwriter, having toured and recorded for over 30 years on the folk and international acoustic circuits.  Both solo and collaborating with partners Chris Caswell, Robin Petrie, and the psychedelic Celtic band Wake the Dead, Danny has released 12 albums, producing or appearing as a guest on 40 more.  Dannys recordings have earned two Indie Awards and one Grammie nomination.  His original songs have been recorded by artists from California to Scotland.  Danny is currently active with Wake the Dead and a new Celtic quartet, Camogie.  When not performing or recording, Danny teaches commercial music at a Bay Area community college.
This is Dannys first novel.  It will shortly be followed by two more.

  <title>Uneasy Lies the Crown - Tasha Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Uneasy Lies the Crown, &lt;/i&gt;the thrilling new mystery in Tasha Alexander&#39;s bestselling series, Lady Emily and her husband Colin must stop a serial killer whose sights may be set on the new king, Edward VII.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her deathbed, Queen Victoria asks to speak privately with trusted agent of the Crown, Colin Hargreaves, and slips him a letter with one last command: &lt;i&gt;Une sanz pluis. Sapere aude.&lt;/i&gt; &quot;One and no more. Dare to know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The year is 1901 and the death of Britain&#39;s longest-reigning monarch has sent the entire British Empire into mourning. But for Lady Emily and her dashing husband, Colin, the grieving is cut short as another death takes center stage. A body has been found in the Tower of London, posed to look like the murdered medieval king Henry VI. When a second dead man turns up in London&#39;s exclusive Berkeley Square, his mutilated remains staged to evoke the violent demise of Edward II, it becomes evident that the mastermind behind the crimes plans to strike again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race to find the killer takes Emily deep into the capital&#39;s underbelly, teeming with secret gangs, street children, and sleazy brothels--but the clues aren&#39;t adding up. Even more puzzling are the anonymous letters Colin has been receiving since Victoria&#39;s death, seeming to threaten her successor, Edward VII. With the killer leaving a trail of dead kings in his wake, will Edward be the next victim?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Jealous One - Celia Fremlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Rosamund and Geoffrey&#39;s new neighbor, Lindy, is smart, good-looking, friendly, and delightful in every way. The problem is Geoffrey&#39;s a little too delighted with her, and his wife is not happy about it. While Rosamund is in a feverish state from a bout of the flu, she dreams of murdering Lindy &amp;#8212; and upon waking is horrified to discover that she&amp;nbsp;has inexplicably disappeared. What could possibly have happened? Was it more than just a terrible nightmare? &lt;BR&gt;&quot;A tense situation, ultimately resolved by a beautifully fitting plot twist,&quot; declared Anthony Boucher in &lt;I&gt;The New York Times&lt;/I&gt;, adding, &quot;Even more memorable than the suspense story is the witty and acute comedy.&quot;&amp;nbsp;Celia Fremlin is noted for injecting her fast-paced psychological thrillers with keen observations of&amp;nbsp;domestic life in the London suburbs during the 1960s. Her other novels, also available from Dover Publications, include &lt;I&gt;Uncle Paul, The Trouble Makers, &lt;/I&gt;and the Edgar Award&amp;#8211;winning classic &lt;I&gt;The Hours Before Dawn.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

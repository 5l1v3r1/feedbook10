  <title>The Corporate Chameleon - Jim A. Roppa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Corporate Chameleon:
When an Italian immigrant comes to Central Illinois in the 1920s, with the pull of a trigger, he is put on a path which will lead to prosperity.  The journey will begin in 1920 and end today.  Three generations from Vincent, then Frankie, to Tommie and Mattie will expose their innermost feelings, and exposes their values, their strengths and weaknesses.  The family mantra is the DNA which runs through their veins; Set No LIMITS, Have No FEAR, and Allow No REMORSE.  
The plot thickens and revolves around twin grandsons.  Both become prominent business leaders.  One has a dark side that uses his business persona to &quot;cover&quot; for his other life.  For Matthew S. Anthony, Mattie, he will epitomize success and be the envy of his corporate peers.  He is loyal to family, friends, and country.  Should loyalties be betrayed, secretly, he is a dangerous assassin to be feared, The Mailman." />

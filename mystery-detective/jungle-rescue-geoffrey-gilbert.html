  <title>Jungle Rescue - Geoffrey Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christina Preston is an American exchange student who has gone against the advice of her Texas billionaire father and decided to attend a prestigious college in Santa Marta, the capital of Magdalena, Colombia. But when masked gunmen storm the university tour bus en route to Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino on a cold October morning, she is kidnapped, shattering her dreams of becoming a research scientist.
Mike Preston is devastated when he learns of his daughters fate and hires retired United States Navy Seal, John Bradley, to find Christina. Desperate, Preston also implores help from an influential Washington figure to exert pressure on Colombian authorities. After Bradley pledges to free Christina and make her captors pay, he heads to Colombia, traveling through jungles and swamps filled with venomous snakes and other hazards. But just when Bradley thinks he is getting somewhere, his efforts to find Christina are thwarted by radical guerrillas who have infiltrated the upper echelons of a key military establishment. While her father anxiously awaits news, now only time will tell if Bradley can overcome his obstacles in enough time to rescue Christina from a ruthless group of rebels.  .
In this gripping international tale, the daughter of a Texas billionaire is kidnapped in Colombia, leaving her future in the hands of a former Navy Seal." />

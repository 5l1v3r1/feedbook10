P.C. Daker, hurrying to the door of Himalaya Villa in River Close, finds the tenant, Robert Dexter, lying dead across his own threshold. After a night&amp;#39;s investigation, Sir Wilfrid Burrows, the Chief Constable, decides to call in New Scotland Yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Gordon Knollis, transferred to the Yard during the war years, is sent down to the city where he had once been the head of the C.I.D. He finds himself faced with a disturbing puzzle, a crime with no apparent motive, and even his knowledge of local conditions does little to help him in his endeavours to unravel it. There is a host of alibis, but he breaks them down one by one in his own inimitable way, eventually resolving the situation and providing a denouement that comes as a surprise even to his own assistant, Sergeant Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable Messenger&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1947.

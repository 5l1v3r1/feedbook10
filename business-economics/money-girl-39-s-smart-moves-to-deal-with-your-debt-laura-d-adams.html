Laura Adams, financial expert and host of the top-rated &lt;i&gt;Money Girl&lt;/i&gt; podcast, is here to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting out of debt might seem overwhelming, but it doesn&#39;t have to be--no matter how much you owe.

She&#39;ll first help you assess your own financial situation so you can create a doable, realistic plan.

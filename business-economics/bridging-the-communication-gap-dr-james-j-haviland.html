  <title>Bridging the Communication Gap - Dr. James J. Haviland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have deep seated and to some extent unconscious concern that I had harbored for some twenty-five years and would continue to research for the next twenty-five years. How could one person be so much more valuable to an organization than another? And more pointedly, how could I become that person? The mystery lay before me. My quest became to solve the mystery of what constitutes individual financial value or worth to an organization and to discern how this dynamic or trait is transferred to personal relationships. If in fact this trait is transferable to personal relationships, it becomes priceless. This book reflects the journey experienced in solving the mystery. Enjoy the journey. Enjoy the future." />

  <title>Risk Bandits - Tony Pooley, Rob Hogarth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Risk Bandits: Rescuing Risk Management from Tokenism&lt;/i&gt; provides directors and executives with a unique yet highly warranted insight into poorly understood organisational risk management practices. As respected business practitioners with extensive experience in meaningful risk management, authors Rob Hogarth and Tony Pooley, have teamed up to turn a clear and unblinking eye upon typical, contemporary organisational risk management and present a take-no-prisoners critique of its often shaky processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book offers directors and executives a must-read critique of typical organisational risk management and proposes an alternative for grounding organisational risk management practices on a solid foundation that protects and creates value.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is not often that I read a book on risk and find myself saying here, here as I turn the pages&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Jean Cross, Emeritus Prof. in Risk, University of NSW
&lt;center&gt;I think this is an excellent book and industry is long overdue for the truth, I cant wait to get my risk managers reading it.&lt;/center&gt; Shayne Arthur, General Manager Risk at Orica
&lt;center&gt;This is a ripping yarn, I was keen to provide feedback before boarding in case I was the victim of a low probability event over the Atlantic.&lt;/center&gt;Norman W Ritchie, vPSI Director
&lt;center&gt;It is an easy read, written in a journalistic style and certainly comprehensively and competently covering the topic&lt;/center&gt; Barry J Cooper, Prof. and Associate Dean at Deakin University Business School" />

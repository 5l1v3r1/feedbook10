  <title>From the Heart. My Autobiography - Sandy Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a high-profile player and manager, Sandy Clark always gave a 100 percent. From his early days with his hometown team Airdrie where he notched more than 100 goals for the club, to his time at Rangers and Hearts and his stint with West Ham, Sandy Clark has seen and done it all. Now Sandy tells the inside story of his rollercoaster career. As a player, there was cup glory with Rangers, derby triumphs at Hearts, a host of controversial bust-ups with the likes of Ally McCoist and Willie Miller and the agony of being just seven minutes from winning the league title in 1986. And later, there was joy when Wallace Mercer gave him his big break as a manager at Hearts, and heartbreak when Mercer sold the club to Chris Robinson, who promptly sacked him. Then there was early success at St Johnstone, later overshadowed by a drugs scandal that rocked the club and Scottish football. Now, as a coach and football pundit, he is respected throughout the game, and in From the Heart Sandy Clark lifts the lid on his controversial career and tells the whole remarkable story for the first time.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />

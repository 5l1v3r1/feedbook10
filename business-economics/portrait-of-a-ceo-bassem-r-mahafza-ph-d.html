      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book presents some unique tools and techniques that each successful entrepreneur ought to follow and adopt in order to guarantee their business growth and success. It primarily focuses on the challenges and difficulties associated with starting, managing, and growing a small business. It takes you through this journey, by addressing many of the obstacles that face individuals who decide to venture out and become self-employed. The discussion is divided so that it matches four distinct phases each small business goes through. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;o The first phase, which is referred to as success by chaos, describes the first 12 months or so of being in business. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;o The next phase, management by chaos, discusses the business challenges of the next 2-5 years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;o Next a discussion of the second set of five years of being in business is presented. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, the books closes by presenting 21 different qualities each small business CEO must master to become a leader in his or her industry. &lt;/P&gt;" />

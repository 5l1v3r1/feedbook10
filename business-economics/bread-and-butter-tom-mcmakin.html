  <title>Bread and Butter - Tom McMakin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bread and Butter&lt;/i&gt; is a book with three parts: First, it&#39;s the story of the birth of an extraordinarily successful kind of business called a &quot;freedom franchise&quot;: Great Harvest Bread Co., which began as one bakery 25 years ago, is now a $60-million-a-year company with 140 stores in 40 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it&#39;s the story of one employee&#39;s success--the author, Tom McMakin, who was looking for a job and found a lifestyle. McMakin&#39;s immersion into Great Harvest is a model for modern entrepreneurship and an inspiration in this age of failed dot-coms and dissatisfied young employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, McMakin uses GH&#39;s experience to provide advice for everyone from dreamers starting their own multi-million-dollar companies to small-business owners to someone who doesn&#39;t know &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;she wants to do. Things like: creating a &quot;learning community&quot; using email and an extranet; operating without loans, relying instead on profits for reinvesting in the company; GH&#39;s &quot;40-hour&quot; rule so no one works more than 40 hours a week; and more. &lt;i&gt;Bread and Butter&lt;/i&gt; can help you discover how, instead of living your life in service to the business, you can create a business in service of your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Cracking the Code of Possibilities in Business - Taiwo Fajolu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If managers, innovative and disruptive entrepreneurs, and opinion leadersespecially the ones in emerging economiesread only one book, this should be it. Taiwos study of the lives of the giants of Western industries and the lessons to be gained from their lives are of utmost relevance to a world suffering from the boom and burst and the cycle of growth and depression characteristic of Western economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a must-read, particularly by the budding entrepreneurs. It is loaded with viable information and aimed at achieving practical and result-oriented actions for developmental and growth objective in this aspect. Taiwos effort in putting this book together is commendable. Lets utilize it productively. &lt;br&gt;

Kolaris Services Group International, LLC &lt;br&gt;
(Enterprise &amp; Manpower Development Consultants), &lt;br&gt;
Willingboro, New Jersey, USA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must commend the efforts, intellect and insight Taiwo have put into this book. One of the most important elements of Nigeria or any country at all becoming a great Nation is her Human Capabilities which makes Capacity Building a must. I will recommend that this book be used to teach in all Business Schools especially in ones that build and breed young Entrepreneurs ...Well Done. &lt;br&gt;
Gbenga Akinyombo, Executive Director, &lt;br&gt;
Subaru Motors Nigeria &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cracking the Code of Possibilities in Business&lt;/i&gt; is a lively, pungent and intellectually stimulating excursion into how Nigeria can rediscover and reposition itself in the comity of nations through innovation, institutional renewal and re-engineering in an era of globalization. Absolutely un-put-down-able. &lt;br&gt;

  <title>Revelations in Business - Dr. K. Shelette Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Business people dont plan to fail; they simply fail to follow Gods plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many books that teach us how to succeed in business. And there are many books that teach us how to apply the Word of God to or lives. What if there was a book that combined the two? Revelations in Business is that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelations in Business, Dr. Stewart combines her core Christian beliefs with her extensive academic and professional experience with Fortune 500 companies, including the Coca-Cola Company and BellSouth Corporation/AT&amp;T, to guide readers through an innovative eight-step divine business-planning approach that will position you to maximize your personal fulfillment and professional success in any industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelations in Business is, without question, The Purpose Driven Life for business leaders. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned leader or just beginning your career, this book is for anyone who desires to achieve success and significance. Arranged in order of a conventional business plan, Revelations in Business offers real-life examples from business leaders, spiritual principles, practical tools, and pragmatic recommendations that you can begin applying immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelations in Business is a powerful tool for progressive leaders who desire to bring insightful, empowering content to their teams to increase employee engagement, productivity, and overall profitability (Dan Cathy, president and chief operating officer, Chick-fil-A Inc.)&lt;/p&gt;" />

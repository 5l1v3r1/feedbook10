      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Learn The Secrets of Marketing via Social Networking Sites!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what you sell on the Internet today &amp;ndash; whether it is eBooks, products you have to mail out for services that you provide yourself &amp;ndash; you need to find customers.&lt;br /&gt;
That much is certain, but the more creative you are at finding those customers (especially when those methods don&amp;rsquo;t involve spending any money) the more successful you are likely to be.&lt;br /&gt;
And that&amp;rsquo;s why it is in your best interests to become familiar with social networking sites. &amp;nbsp;Not to tell people all about what you do in your spare time, or to share the intimate details of your life with, but to use as a method to gain more business.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, there are thousands of customers to be found on these sites. &amp;nbsp;Despite the fact that they are intended for social purposes, they can be used for business purposes too. &amp;nbsp;You just need to know how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;
And there is no doubt that the people who are doing it already are reaping the rewards. &amp;nbsp;There are such a high proportion of internet users who are members of at least one social networking site that you are ignoring a huge number of potential customers if you don&amp;rsquo;t at least try it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Facebook alone has over a hundred million users as of the middle of 2008, so you can see just how big an opportunity this is. Right? Get more information inside this eBook." />

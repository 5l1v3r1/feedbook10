  <title>So You Want to Be a Landlord - Michael J. Margolis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its no secret that the majority of wealth is tied to real estate. After experiencing success, my wife and I have become somewhat evangelical about real estate. Furthermore, this is a great way to build self-esteem, equity, and retirement for yourself and your family. If youre interested in a get-rich-quick scheme, put this book back on the shelf and pick up one of the many other books on the topic. I do not have seminars and progressive steps to my approach, at least not yet. What I have done, and my philosophy, is to provide a somewhat simple and realistic approach to property investing. Hopefully, you will see the benefit of property investing and try this on your own. Perhaps the greatest barrier to investing in property is overcoming fear. I am reminded of the Nike slogan from the eighties Just do it. Whenever anyone incredulously asks me how I got into real estate, the simple answer is that I simply did." />

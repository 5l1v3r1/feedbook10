  <title>Your Exit Map - John F Dini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fast paced, enjoyable to read and even more fun to look at, &lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Navigating the Boomer Bust&lt;/em&gt; is a new kind of business book for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern technology and the Internet combine to surpass the drab, text filled &amp;ldquo;drone tomes&amp;rdquo; that fill too many business owners&amp;rsquo; shelves.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Over 200 illustrations, photos, graphs and cartoons take the reader through the historical shifts that created a generation of Boomer entrepreneurs, and the equally powerful forces that are assembling to challenge their successful transitions. Humor and insight share each page, mixing entertainment with critical information for planning the biggest financial event of most entrepreneurs&amp;rsquo; careers.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt; covers the various strategies for transferring a business to new ownership. It describes the features that attract different classes of buyers, how they target companies for acquisition, and their methodologies for assigning value.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This is not an exit planning encyclopedia. &lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt; offers a high-level overview of how to use simple tools to determine the balance of priorities between your retirement timeframe, financial goals, and your desire to preserve the legacy of what you&amp;rsquo;ve built. It explains sales through business brokers, competitive acquisitions, private equity, leveraged buyouts, ESOPs and family transfers; describing the parameters for extracting maximum proceeds from each approach.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt; also features interviews with owners who have exited their businesses with varying levels of success. In their own words, they describe the best and worst things that happened as they prepared to exit, during the process and afterwards. Their stories bring home the joys and pitfalls hat accompany such a major change in lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Author John F. Dini has won multiple book awards for his conversational but insightful approach to business writing. This is a book that you will read, tell friends about, and then read again.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map: Navigating the Boomer Bust&lt;/em&gt; is supplemented by an online library of &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; interactive planning tools, checklists and educational resources at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.YourExitMap.com&quot;&gt;www.YourExitMap.com&lt;/a&gt;. Each tool referenced in the book is available for instantly modeling your own plan, along with articles, white papers and the author&amp;rsquo;s own exit planning blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Awakeat2oclock.com&quot;&gt;www.Awakeat2oclock.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Your Exit Map has been praised by leading authors of business books, as well as the CEOs of business owner organizations.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In his books and articles, John F. Dini has long been one of the most reliable sources of wisdom for entrepreneurs, especially those preparing to transition out of their companies. With &lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt;, he has written another book that manages to be both entertaining and informative.&lt;br /&gt;
~ Bo Burlingham, author of &lt;em&gt;Finish Big&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Small Giants&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic and necessary read for anyone who is looking to sell their business successfully. It is full of great content that will no doubt be valuable to anyone who is either in the process of selling their business, or considering their exit strategy. John Dini has demonstrated great value in his previous books, and this one is no exception.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;~&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Jason P. Zickerman, President and CEO, The Alternative Board International&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your Exit Map&lt;/em&gt; is an eye opener. It&amp;rsquo;s a must read for any business owner who wonders why he or she should be planning ahead for an exit. Most struggle with the exit phase. This book is a road map for getting it right&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;

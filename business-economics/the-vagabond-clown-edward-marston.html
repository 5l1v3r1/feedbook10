In the midst of the rotten-vegetable battlefield, one of the audience members is found stabbed, and their masterful clown, Barnaby Gill, is discovered with a broken leg.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; With the company clown-less, they must find a replacement before they embark on their tour of Kent. Enter Gideon Mussett, a ruffian, scallywag and all around drunk. Thinking the victim in the theatre was an accident. Nicholas Bracewell and his fellows soon learn that there is more to this death than a drunken brawl. With a murderer still on the loose, it appears further deaths are on the cards, but who will be the second victim?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />

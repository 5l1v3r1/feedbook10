  <title>Summary: e-Strategy Pure &amp; Simple - Michel Robert and Bernard Racine - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “E-STRATEGY PURE &amp;amp; SIMPLE: Connecting Your Internet Strategy To Your Business Strategy” by Michel Robert and Bernard Racine.Michel Robert is founder and president of Decision Processes International Inc., a consulting firm with 60 partners in 15 countries. Since coining the phrase “strategic thinking” in 1980, Mr. Robert has had a number of articles published in business magazines and journals. Bernard Racine is director of research and development at Decision Processes International Inc.Many CEOs are baffled by the Internet, and are delegating their decisions about an Internet strategy to consultants and IT staff. The only problem is that’s roughly equivalent to having a plumber design a new house – you end up with loads of pipes but not much else. Similarly, when Internet consultants or IT staff design an e-business strategy, you end with loads of nice hardware and software but it doesn’t quite mesh with the strategy the rest of the business is following.To overcome this mismatch, CEOs and key executives should become the architects of their own e-strategy which not only connects to the business strategy of the entire company but helps further execute that strategy rather than working at cross purposes. Packed with real-life examples, this well-researched book presents basic imperatives to develop a coherent Internet strategy." />

  <title>Retire Richer Younger - Barbara Smith, Ed Koken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The government is encouraging us to stay in the workforce for longer but how many of us really want to work until we are 67 then retire on a pension?  It doesn&#39;t have to be like that. You can take control of your financial destiny and Retire Richer, Younger. If you haven&#39;t already started on your financial journey you can&#39;t change the past but you can begin now! Whether you are 21 or 61, this book is designed to assist you in planning for an earlier retirement date and a more financially secure retirement. It encourages readers to review their own situation:- How much have I got already?- How much will I need?- How can I achieve my financial goals earlier?- What do I need to do when I retire? It&#39;s never too early or too late to start planning for retirement. The sooner you start building assets, the earlier you can retire, and the more likely you are to be able to fully self-fund your retirement. But if that achievement is not possible the part-pension option may be the way to go. There are various ways of funding your retirement and Smith and Koken explain many of them in this book. Superannuation and taxation experts, Barbara Smith and Ed Koken explain the importance of budgeting, saving and investing wisely over your working life. Perhaps most importantly they explain how superannuation can help you reach your goals sooner." />

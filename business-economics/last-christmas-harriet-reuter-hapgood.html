  <title>Last Christmas - Harriet Reuter Hapgood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&#39;s better than a Christmas sweater? Taking it off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A saucy Christmas novella to heat up your winter nights!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&#39;s the end of a disastrous first term at Cambridge University for shy, incurable romantic 19-year-old Candy, and the ache of missing her ex-boyfriend has her acting out of character - arguing with fellow student Griffin, giving sexy Scottish Jamie her number.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there&#39;s this Film Studies essay... Desperate to do well, she seeks an online lesson in &quot;being cynical&quot; from the mysterious @GoldenEagle. A weekend of anti-Christmas party mix-ups, Festive Film Fest misunderstandings, and sexy make-out sessions ensues. Until Candy realises Jamie and @GoldenEagle aren&#39;t the same guy - and she has to choose who she really loves and who she really is. LAST CHRISTMAS is part of Hot Key Books&#39; exclusive new novella list, and one of a series of five available this Christmas. Unlock your naughty side!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Harriet has worked in TV, fashion journalism (writing for everyone from J17 to INSTYLE, and once yelling on the radio about her love of Christmas jumpers), and she now moonlights as a human spellchecker. She was born in Nottingham, has lived in Southampton, Cambridge, Surrey, and Newcastle (where she got a first class degree in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), and now shares a freezing house in south London with her cat, Stanley (who&#39;s a girl, by the way), and assorted friends. When she&#39;s not writing, Harriet refreshes Twitter a lot, eats too many burritos, and does felt-tip pen drawings of unicorns.

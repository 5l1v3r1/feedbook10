  <title>Decide to Profit: 9 Steps to a Better Bottom Line - Dorriah Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Dr. Dorriah Rogers, CEO of Paradyne Consulting Works, shares her last twelve years of consulting and research for numerous Fortune 100 and 500 companies, large government entities and the U.S. military in her book &lt;I&gt;Decide to Profit: 9 Steps to a Better Bottom Line&lt;/I&gt;. The book is the result of discussions and intensive problem-solving with thousands of employees, managers and executives experiencing an inability to tie innovation and growth to bottom-line profit; where due to market pressure for growth, managers found themselves pushing decision-making to the lowest levels of the organization, and companies were finding themselves in need of a tool to ensure that these decisions were executed in a safe and profitable way.  In other words, as their organizations grew, net margin and productivity began to erode, and a solution was required.  &lt;I&gt;Decide to Profit&lt;/I&gt; provides a step-by-step guide for organizations to connect all ideas and decisions that affect change to the financial goals of the company.  Employees will have a clear systematic process that links decisions to the financial performance of their organization. Managers will have a ready tool to shape their organizational culture and business outcomes. With this process, both leaders and employees can adapt to increasingly tough competition and excel within their ever-changing markets, while ultimately maintaining or growing net profit.  The 9 Step process has been vetted and implemented within some of the largest and most complex projects and organizations across North America, and it works.&lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Each of the 9 Steps shows you how to avoid common decision-making mistakes, provides checklists and tools to foster a creative and idea-driven culture within organizations, and includes easy-to-understand and implement guidelines to ensure a financially sound future. The nine chapters chronologically and systematically outline each of the steps and its application, and include checklists, critical questions, and easy-to-use forms for managers and employees. Imbedded within each step are checks and balances and a process for accountability, so managers and employees can remain in sync in both their thinking and actions.  A user code will be provided to book purchasers allowing them to access tips for easy-to-download forms on the &lt;I&gt;Decide to Profit&lt;/I&gt; website. The website will also include a user forum, a best practices blog and tips from the author.&lt;/div&gt;" />

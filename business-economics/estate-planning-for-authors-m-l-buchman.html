  <title>Estate Planning for Authors - M. L. Buchman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="-an estate planning self-help guide for artists &amp; writers-
Writer, painter, photographer, musician, designer, animator, graphic artist, programmer, screenwriter, textile artist, choreographer, composer, sculptor...
A will or trust controls who inherits what. The Final Letter tells your heir(s) ways to maintain it, even make it thrive, once they’ve got it.
The challenge with an estate that includes Intellectual Property (books, stories, plays, films, etc.), is it has a value that can last another 70 years after your death. 
This book is a practical guide for educating your heir on quite what they’ve just received and what their options are to manage it. Topics also include: basic vocabulary, income opportunities with Intellectual Property, the power of trusts in IP estate planning, and much more.
Estate Planning for Authors will help authors create their Final Letter as well as help the heirs whose benefactor did not create one.
It’s a guide on how to make sure your legacy remains profitable for decades after you’re gone!" />

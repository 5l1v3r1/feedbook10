  <title>Beat the Cuts: How to Improve Public Services and Easily Cut Costs - Rob Worth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to improve public services and easily cut costs.  While the public sector is faced with axing services to save billions and deliver 25% - 40% budget cuts, there are organisations that are not only saving services but improving them and massively cutting costs as a result. Public sector leaders are currently weighing up heart-wrenching decisions to slash public services. This book shows that these dilemmas can be avoided. With no complex change programmes, expensive IT projects or extended training courses, this book describes a simple but effective method. It starts with the key questions and actions that will overcome resistance to change, enthuse staff and get concrete results in weeks. One government department, described in the book, discovered how to remove 52% of the calls to its new contact centre, eliminate 91% of its process steps and drastically improve service to its users. A 25% - 40% cut in budget is easy when you know how. If you are involved in the public sector and don&#39;t want to see services decimated, this is a must read book. www.BeatTheCuts.com" />

  <title>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics - Donna Brazile, Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, Minyon Moore...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s a wonderful, necessary book.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Hillary Clinton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The four most powerful African American women in politics share the story of their friendship and how it has changed politics in America.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lives of black women in American politics are remarkably absent from the shelves of bookstores and libraries. &lt;i&gt;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics&lt;/i&gt; is a sweeping view of American history from the vantage points of four women who have lived and worked behind the scenes in politics for over thirty years--Donna Brazile, Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, and Minyon Moore--a group of women who call themselves The Colored Girls. Like many people who have spent their careers in public service, they view their lives in four-year waves where presidential campaigns and elections have been common threads. For most of the Colored Girls, their story starts with Jesse Jackson&#39;s first campaign for president. From there, they went on to work on the presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, they&#39;ve filled many roles: in the corporate world, on campaigns, in unions, in churches, in their own businesses and in the White House. Through all of this, they&#39;ve worked with those who have shaped our country&#39;s history--US Presidents such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well-known political figures such as Terry McAuliffe and Howard Dean, and legendary activists and historical figures such as Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, and Betty Shabazz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics&lt;/i&gt; is filled with personal stories that bring to life heroic figures we all know and introduce us to some of those who&#39;ve worked behind the scenes but are still hidden. Whatever their perch, the Colored Girls are always focused on the larger goal of &quot;hurrying history&quot; so that every American -- regardless of race, gender or religious background -- can have a seat at the table. This is their story.&lt;/p&gt;" />

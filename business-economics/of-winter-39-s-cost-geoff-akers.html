  <title>Of Winter&#39;s Cost - Geoff Akers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam wants to follow the path ordained by his father and his fellow Jewish settlers living on the dangerous West Bank, but is haunted by his grandfather&#39;s tales from the Holocaust and disturbed by the vicious tactics employed by his comrades against their Arab neighbours. He soon comes to realise that the victims of anti-Semitism have become the victimisers in an increasingly bitter struggle for land. Of Winter&#39;s Cost launches an uncompromising attack on all forms of racism whether instigated by the Nazis during the Second World War or by Jewish fundamentalists on the West bank. The heroes are a survivor of the Holocaust, who finds it in his heart to forgive the enemies of his people, and a young man struggling to discover where his true loyalties lie.Sam wants to follow the path ordained by his father and his fellow Jewish settlers living on the dangerous West Bank, but is haunted by his grandfather&#39;s tales from the Holocaust and disturbed by the vicious tactics employed by his comrades against their Arab neighbours.

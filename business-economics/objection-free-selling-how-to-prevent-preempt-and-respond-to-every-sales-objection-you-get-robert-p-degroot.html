  <title>Objection Free Selling: How to Prevent, Preempt, and Respond to Every Sales Objection You Get - Robert P DeGroot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This unique book contains the knowledge, skills, and strategies you need to prevent, preempt, and respond to every sales objection you get. It even has what you need to know to answer the unanswerable objections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Research shows there are ten Buyer Beliefs. Objections occur when these beliefs are weak or missing.&amp;nbsp; Research also shows there are many ways to establish each belief.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Test this. Before you buy something, this book for example, what must you believe about it? Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t believe that you could use it, what objection comes to mind? One could be, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need it.&amp;rdquo; But if you do believe you need it, what happens to this particular objection? It never comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You just demonstrated that missing Buyer Beliefs cause objections and that they are prevented when the corresponding Buyer Belief is in place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most salespeople get objections in only three or four of the ten Buyer Belief categories, therefore, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn a new sales model. The one you use now may work fine except in a few places where objections are getting through. All you need to do is plug the correct strategies into your current sales model to handle these objections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book provides examples of how to prevent, preempt, and respond to each of the 85 most common sales stopping objections. Scan the list starting on page eight and make note of those that are similar to the ones you get. Look them up in the book and personalize the recommendations to your sales situation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just imagine what it would have been like if your boss on your first day at work in sales had said, &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;sales strategy book&amp;rsquo; that has every objection our sales team gets for each of our products/services when selling against each of our competitors. This book has strategies and tactics you can use to PREVENT objections from entering the prospect&amp;rsquo;s mind. But if you see on the Competitor Analysis that the objection already exists, then look at the examples of how to PREEMPT it and if need be, the scripted examples of how to RESPOND using tactics our team has used successfully in the past. Go ahead and personalize them to your style.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What would that book have been worth to you?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Get this book now and start customizing and personalizing the strategies and tactics for each and every objection you get. Build your own sales strategy book. How great will you feel when you can handle any objection that comes your way?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A year from now you may wish you had started today.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Karen Lamb, Author&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Get started today, buy the book now, and never again get an objection you can&amp;rsquo;t handle!&lt;/p&gt;" />

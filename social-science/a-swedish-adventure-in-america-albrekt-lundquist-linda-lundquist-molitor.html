  <title>A SWEDISH ADVENTURE IN AMERICA - Albrekt Lundquist, Linda Lundquist Molitor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine being 20 years old, leaving your home to go to another country&amp;mdash;alone and unable to communicate!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the story of a young man leaving his home in Sweden to find the &amp;ldquo;streets of gold&amp;rdquo; in America.&amp;nbsp; There are seven journals that are rich in information about his journey.&amp;nbsp; It includes the cost of living during the early 1900&amp;#39;s, both monetary and personal.&amp;nbsp; It is a story of hardship, disappointment, struggle, and limitless tenacity all done with a pragmatic sense of humor and eloquence.&amp;nbsp; Albrekt&amp;#39;s experiences were full of topics which you will recognize from locations to politics to famous people to events and his opinions of the World War I for which he was drafted to fight for America.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It is a running commentary in which he saw Sarah Bernhard perform, Axel Skovgaard play violin, a Tent revival with Dan Shannon, the Golden Gate Park and it&amp;#39;s exhibits and museums, San Francisco&amp;#39;s China Town, New York City and the Hippodrome. He describes Henry Ford&amp;#39;s automobiles as they were beginning to be a part of American culture. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
You will read how life really was for immigrants from other countries at the beginning of the early 1900s---and it is a timely lesson for both immigrants and young people today who are also looking for those same &amp;ldquo;streets of gold&amp;rdquo;. These journals tell how things really haven&amp;#39;t changed much from then to now in those same struggles when starting out a new life in another country and struggling to make a good living.&lt;/p&gt;" />

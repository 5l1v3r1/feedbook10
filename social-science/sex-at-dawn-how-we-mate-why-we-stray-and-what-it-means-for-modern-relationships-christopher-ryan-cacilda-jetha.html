  <title>Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships - Christopher Ryan, Cacilda Jetha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Sex at Dawn&lt;/em&gt; challenges conventional wisdom about sex in a big way. By examining the prehistoric origins of human sexual behavior the authors are able to expose the fallacies and weaknesses of standard theories proposed by most experts. This is a provocative, entertaining, and pioneering book. I learned a lot from it and recommend it highly.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Andrew Weil, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Sex at Dawn&lt;/em&gt; irrefutably shows that what is obvious&amp;#8212;that human beings, both male and female, are lustful&amp;#8212;is true, and has always been so&amp;#8230;. The more dubious its evidentiary basis and lack of connection with current reality, the more ardently the scientific inevitability of monogamy is maintained&amp;#8212;even as it falls away around us.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Stanton Peele, Ph.D. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A controversial, idea-driven book that challenges everything you (think you) know about sex, monogamy, marriage, and family. In the words of Steve Taylor (&lt;em&gt;The Fall, Waking From Sleep&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Sex at Dawn&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;#8220;a wonderfully provocative and well-written book which completely re-evaluates human sexual behavior and gets to the root of many of our social and psychological ills.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;" />

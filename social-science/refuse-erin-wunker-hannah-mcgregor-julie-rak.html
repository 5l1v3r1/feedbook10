  <title>Refuse - Erin Wunker, Hannah McGregor, Julie Rak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CanLit&amp;ndash;the commonly used short form for English Canadian Literature as a cultural formation and industry&amp;mdash;has been at the heart of several recent public controversies. Why? Because CanLit is breaking open to reveal the accepted injustices at its heart. It is imperative that these public controversies and the issues that sparked them be subject to careful and thorough discussion and critique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Refuse&lt;/i&gt; provides a critical and historical context to help readers understand conversations happening about CanLit presently. One of its goals is to foreground the perspectives of those who have been changing the conversation about what CanLit is and what it could be. Topics such as literary celebrity, white power, appropriation, class, rape culture, and the ongoing impact of settler colonialism are addressed by a diverse gathering of writers from across Canada. This volume works to avoid a single metanarrative response to these issues, but rather brings together a cacophonous multitude of voices." />

  <title>The Constitution in Exile - Andrew P. Napolitano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What ever happened to our inalienable rights?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Constitution was once the bedrock of our country, an unpretentious parchment that boldly established the God-given rights and freedoms of America. Today that parchment has been shred to ribbons, explains Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, as the federal government trounces state and individual rights and expands its reach far beyond what the Framers intended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An important follow-up to Judge Napolitano&#39;s best-selling &lt;em&gt;Constitutional Chaos&lt;/em&gt;, this book shows with no-nonsense clarity how Congress has &quot;purchased&quot; regulations by bribing states and explains how the Supreme Court has devised historically inaccurate, logically inconsistent, and even laughable justifications to approve what Congress has done. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s an exciting excursion into the dark corners of the law, showing how do-gooders, busybodies, and control freaks in government disregard the limitations imposed upon Congress by the Constitution and enact laws, illegal and unnatural, in virtually every area of human endeavor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Constitution in Exile&lt;/em&gt; from Left, Right, and Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Does anyone understand the vision of America&#39;s founding fathers? The courts and Congress apparently don&#39;t have a clue. But Judge Andrew P. Napolitano does, and so will you, if you read &lt;em&gt;The Constitution in Exile&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;-&lt;strong&gt;BILL O&#39;REILLY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever happened to states rights, limited government, and natural law? Judge Napolitano, in his own inimitable style, takes us on a fascinating tour of the destruction of constitutional government. If you want to know how the federal government got so big and fat, read this book. Agree or disagree, this book will make you think.&quot;-&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;In all of the American media, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano is the most persistent, uncompromising guardian of both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, very much including the Bill of Rights. Increasingly, our Constitution is in clear and present danger. Judge Napolitano--in &lt;em&gt;The Constitution in Exile&lt;/em&gt;--has challenged all Americans across party lines to learn the extent of this constitutional crisis.&quot; -&lt;strong&gt;NAT HENTOFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Judge Napolitano engages here in what I do every day on my program-make you think. There&#39;s no question that potential Supreme Court nominees and what our Constitution says and doesn&#39;t say played a major role for many voters in our last couple of elections. What the judge does here is detail why the federal government claims it can regulate as well as tax everything in sight as it grows and grows. Agree or disagree with him-you need to read his latest book, think, and begin to arm yourself as you enter this important debate.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;-RUSH LIMBAUGH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time when we are, in Benjamin Franklin&#39;s words, sacrificing essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, here comes the judge with what should be mandatory reading for the executive branch cronies who are busy stealing power while they think we&#39;re not watching. Thank goodness the judge is watching and speaking truth to power. More than a book, this is an emergency call to philosophical arms, one we must heed before it&#39;s too late.&quot; -&lt;strong&gt;ALAN COLMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

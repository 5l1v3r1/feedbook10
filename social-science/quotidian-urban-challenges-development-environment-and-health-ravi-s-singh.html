  <title>Quotidian Urban Challenges Development, Environment and Health - Ravi S. Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;India, like other Asian countries, is urbanizing quite rapidly. And, both persisting and emerging urban problems are acquiring unprecedented form and dimensions. The available academic works are generally over-burdened with theoretical issues and in many cases with abstraction. This book therefore seeks to bring together studies on some contemporary everyday-quotidian-urban problems an average Indian urban dweller confronts, like (ever-increasing) crowding, housing (shortage), garbage (mishandling), (increasing) pollution, (deteriorating) health and above all the need for effective and efficient governance. It is quite a worthwhile systematic treatment to such issues in a single volume that specifically provides a peep into all of them together. Contents Foreword Professor (Dr.) V.C. Jha, Director National Atlas Thematic Mapping Organisation (NATMO), Kolkata 1. Nature of emerging quotidian urban challenges: Ravi S. Singh 2. 21st century Asian cities: Bharat Dahiya 3. Urban growth, sprawl and their consequences: Ravi S. Singh and Satyendra N. Singh 4. Slums and urban environmental challenges in India: Arun K. Singh 5. High-rise buildings in metropolitan cities: Lakshmi Sivaramakrishnan and Jayarati Dasgupta 6. Environment and sustainability in the Third World cities: Srabani Sanyal 7. Industrialization and quality of air: Piyal Basu Roy and Keshab Mondol 8. Management of solid waste in Indian cities: Abha Lakshmi Singh and Salahuddin Mohd. Khan 9. Solid waste management in Varanasi City: Shweta Yadav and Ram Bilas 10. Health situation in an urban environment: Amrita Dwivedi and V. K. Kumra 11. Risk zone assessment of an environmental health hazard: G.V. Narasimha Rao, B.V. Shiva Kumar and B. Hema Malini. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

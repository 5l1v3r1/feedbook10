  <title>The Biggest Game in Town - Al Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Al Alvarez touched down in Las Vegas one hot day in 1981, a dedicated amateur poker player but a stranger to the town and its crazy ways. For three mesmerizing weeks he witnessed some of the monster high-stakes games that could only have happened in Vegas and talked to the extraordinary characters who dominated them--road gamblers and local professionals who won and lost fortunes on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set over the course of one tournament, &lt;i&gt;The Biggest Game in Town&lt;/i&gt; is botha  chronicle of the World Series of Poker--the first ever written--and a portrait of the hustlers, madmen, and geniuses who ruled the high-stakes game in America. It is a brilliant insight into poker&#39;s appeal as a hobby, an addiction, and a way of life, and into the skewed psychology of master players and fearless gamblers. With a new introduction by the author, Alvarez&#39;s classic account is &quot;the greatest dissection of high-stakes Vegas poker and the madness that surrounds it ever written&quot; (&lt;i&gt;TimeOut&lt;/i&gt; [UK]).&lt;/p&gt;" />

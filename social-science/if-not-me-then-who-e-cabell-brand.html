  <title>If Not Me, Then Who? - E. Cabell Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;President Jimmy Carter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people in America have had such a wide range of exciting experiences as Cabell Brand. He used his experiences as an accomplished business leader to form a remarkable partnership between governments at all levels and his own local community. This brief but profound text will prove beneficial to all young people who wish to follow in his footsteps in strengthening American society in areas of their own individual interest and competence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Senator Mark Warner - Former Governor of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabell Brand is a dear friend who Ive come to know both as a leader in business and as a role model in his community. The personal stories and experiences he so generously shares in this book, on issues ranging from education to health care and the environment, provide a compelling and readable case for more civic engagement from everyone. Whats more  Cabells life story provides a useful guide for the next generation of leaders to step-up to continue his legacy of working to provide opportunities for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President of the National Academy of Sciences, Ralph Cicerone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabell Brand is an accomplished leader whose adherence to American ideals and his effectiveness make him rare. Even more rare, he demonstrates through genuine and encouraging experiences that many more people can become new leaders in our quest for better governance and a better society. An uplifting book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMI Superintendent General J.H. Binford Peay, III, U.S. Army (Retired) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabell Brands life exemplifies the concept of the citizen-soldier, the foundation upon which his alma mater, the Virginia Military Institute, was built. He served his country during World War II before embarking on a remarkable career in business, with simultaneous involvement at home and abroad as regards humanitarian causes. I have known few individuals who have been as successful in industry while giving so selflessly of their time and effort with civic affairs, the underprivileged, the environment and the general well being of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />

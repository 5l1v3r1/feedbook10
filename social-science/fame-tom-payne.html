  <title>Fame - Tom Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We may regard celebrities as deities, but that does not mean we worship them with deference. From prehistory to the present, humanity has possessed a primal urge first to exalt the famous but then to cut them down (Michael Jackson, anyone?). Why do we treat the ones we love like burnt offerings in a ritual of human sacrifice? Perhaps because that is exactly what they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Greek mythology to the stories of the Christian martyrs and Dr. Faustus, Payne makes the fascinating argument that our relationship to celebrity is perilous, and that we wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. He also shows that the people we choose as our heroes and villains throughout the ages says a lot about ourselves--and what it says is often quite frightening. &lt;i&gt;Fame&lt;/i&gt; even brings new life to all the literary figures from our high school English classes. In these pages, the most ephemeral reality television stars (those &quot;famous for being famous&quot;) find themselves in the same VIP lounge as the characters of &lt;i&gt;The Iliad&lt;/i&gt;. With great wit, scholarship, and insight, Tom Payne draws the narratives of the past and the present into one intriguing story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fame&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling, hilarious look at the mortals, and the immortals--us and them.&lt;/p&gt;" />

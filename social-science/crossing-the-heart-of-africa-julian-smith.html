  <title>Crossing the Heart of Africa - Julian Smith</title>

Grogan, seeking to prove his worth and earn his love&#39;s hand, then set out on an epic quest to become the first man to cross the entire length of Africa, from Cape Town to Cairo, &quot;a feat hitherto thought by many explorers to be impossible&quot; (&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little more than a century later, American journalist Julian Smith also found himself madly in love with his girlfriend of seven years... but he was terrified by the prospect of marraige. Inspired by Grogan&#39;s story, which he discovered by chance, Smith decided to face his fears of commitment by retracing the explorer&#39;s amazing&amp;#8212;but now forgotten&amp;#8212;4,500-mile journey for love and glory through Africa. &lt;em&gt;Crossing the Heart of Africa&lt;/em&gt; is the unforgettable account of these twin adventures, as Smith beautifully ineterweaves his own contemporary journey with Grogan&#39;s larger-than-life tale of cannibal attacks, charging elephants, deadly jungles, and romantic triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOCIETY OF AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITERS WESTERN WRITING AWARDS WINNER: GOLD PRIZE (TRAVEL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANFF MOUNTAIN BOOK COMPETITION WINNER: SPECIAL JURY MENTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMERICAN SOCIETY OF JOURNALISTS AND AUTHORS AWARDS BEST-BOOK WINNER: MEMOIR&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Motherhood is Madness - Maureen F Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why mothers are still unhappy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothers today feel like they are going absolutely crazy. They are exhausted, underpaid and under-appreciated. They feel like slaves to their kids, homes, husbands and careers &amp;ndash; just like our mothers did. So what went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people blame mothers for this state of affairs. We tell women that motherhood is blissful and it&amp;rsquo;s up to them to find work-life balance. We remind them that they chose to have children and can decide if they wish to have a career or not. But how free are their choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the suffragists and feminists fail mothers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book gets to the heart of the reasons why mothers are unhappy today and what&amp;rsquo;s really holding them back.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It shifts the blame from mothers, to hundreds of pressures that make it extraordinarily difficult for mothers to flourish. This book is an easy-to-read summary of the extensive academic research on motherhood.&amp;nbsp; It not only describes the 15 main barriers that women face but also provides 15 practical strategies, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;stop asking mothers to choose career or family&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;never expect mothers to be martyrs to kids&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;make childcare available, affordable and acceptable&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;question the 24/7 work culture and the mommy penalty&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;adopt a partnership model of the family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other books that urge women to be super-moms, this book focuses on the whole institution of motherhood consisting of our traditional family model, our traditions and out-dated beliefs.&amp;nbsp; Although &amp;nbsp;motherhood may be madness, it need not be. This book provides a &lt;em&gt;manifesto&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;anyone &lt;/em&gt;who wants mothers to be happy and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Maureen F. Fitzgerald&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, LLM, JD, BComm is a former lawyer, law professor and gender expert. She is also a mother and the author of twelve books. She practiced law for 20 years, has two law degrees, a business degree and a doctorate degree. As one of Canada&amp;rsquo;s most articulate and outspoken advocates for social justice and equality she calls herself a maven on a mission.&lt;/p&gt;" />

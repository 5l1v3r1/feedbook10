  <title>Small-Screen Souths: Region, Identity, and the Cultural Politics of Television - Hubert H. Humphrey, Robert Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brought up on Wilsonian democracy and populist ideals, a young Hubert Humphrey witnessed the near-failure of the American political system during the Great Depression and its revival under Franklin D. Roosevelt. In &lt;EM&gt;The Political Philosophy of the New Deal&lt;/EM&gt;, Humphrey responds to the changing political landscape of his early adulthood and offers a broad-ranging analysis of the New Deal and its place in the American traditions of individualism and social responsibility. First published in 1970, Humphrey&#39;s book makes the case that the New Deal, by emphasizing stability for all citizens, situated itself firmly within the traditions of American democracy. His cogent assessment of Roosevelt&#39;s policies offers insights still applicable in current-day discourse about the financial and social sectors within the United States. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This paperback edition includes a new foreword by Robert Mann, who explains the enduring importance of Humphrey&#39;s work and makes a strong case for the relevance of Humphrey&#39;s ideas in today&#39;s political climate." />

  <title>Deferred Pay, Mergers and Acquisitions and Sectoral Deflation, Frame Deconstructions - Andreas Daniel Fogg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A few corrections to these pieces have been made. For the most part I have left them as they were sent out. Some or many of these pieces, it has been suggested to me, have been posted on a bulletin board at the Harvard Law School. Whether or not anyone pays any attention to them, I cannot say. Most have been sent to various members of the Harvard, Yale and other university faculty. There has been little or no direct feedback from these recipients, as to even whether the emails were opened. Occasionally, perhaps twice, I was asked to stop sending the emails. 
My methodology has been to follow the news and news analysis of various journalists and social scientists; to build my analyses upon those of others, hopefully leading to a set of prescriptions which, if taken seriously, might better the overall conditions of the United States as well as that of the world at large. 
What I am urging is a shift in the SEC&#39;s and DOJ criteria for approving M and A;s away from intra sectoral approvals, justified apparently if not always nominally, by economies of scale and abilities to control the markets and pricing, toward cross sectoral actions justified by the increased ability to lower prices and raise wages.
Other parts of the book deal with the subject of deferred or not fully distributed corporate or other forms of institutional pay on the grounds that initial recipients might not be mature enough for immediate receipt, or now, in hindsight, that the potential recipient would find herself or himself in some crucial senses compromised or otherwise hampered by full receipt of accurately earned rewards." />

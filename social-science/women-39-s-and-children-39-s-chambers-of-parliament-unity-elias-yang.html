  <title>Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Chambers of Parliament - Unity Elias Yang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oh men! As our eyes cannot ignore the beauty and charm of our women, our ears should not ignore the cries of their suffering and neglect. Unity Yang
Women and children need to become aware of the necessity for them to speak for themselves, and to understand what they lose when others speak for them. This book does not speak for women and children, but seeks to alert everyone on the importance for each group in the society to speak for itself.
Women, is this true?
Women rely on men for shelter, sustenance, opinions, hobbies, conversation topicsin short, for a reason to live. They spend their lives engaged in useless, repetitive activities. It is less demanding and less exhausting to abdicate all responsibility for ones future to a man. Simone de Beauvoir
Men, is this true? 
Being men, those who have made and compiled the laws have favored their own sex. Poulain de la Barre
Marriage should be celebrated following premarital training designed to give the future couple a true picture of what living together will be.  
Unity Elias Yang is the author of:
-A Global State through Democratic Federal World Government
- The Third World where is it?
- Last Great Queen?
- Your Babys long journey to school
- Little Anita visits the Bank
- Children and Citizenship (classes 1 -6)" />

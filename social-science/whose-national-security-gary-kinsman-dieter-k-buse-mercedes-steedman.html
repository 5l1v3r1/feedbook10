  <title>Whose National Security? - Gary Kinsman, Dieter K. Buse, Mercedes Steedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Would you believe that RCMP operatives used to spy on Tupperware parties? In the 1950s and &amp;#8217;60s they did. They also monitored high school students, gays and lesbians, trade unionists, left-wing political groups, feminists, consumer&amp;#8217;s associations, Black activists, First Nations people, and Quebec sovereignists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The establishment of a tenacious Canadian security state came as no accident. On the contrary, the highest levels of government and the police, along with non-governmental interests and institutions, were involved in a concerted campaign. The security state grouped ordinary Canadians into dozens of political stereotypes and labelled them as threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whose National Security?&lt;/em&gt; probes the security state&amp;#8217;s ideologies and hidden agendas, and sheds light on threats to democracy that persist to the present day. The contributors&amp;#8217; varied approaches open up avenues for reconceptualizing the nature of spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;* &quot;APEC Days at UBC: Student Protests and National Security in an Era of Trade Liberalization,&quot; Karen Pearlston
* &quot;Remembering Federal Police Surveillance in Quebec, 1940s-70s,&quot; Madeleine Parent
* &quot;The Red Petticoat Brigade: Mine Mill Women&#39;s Auxiliaries and the Threat from Within, 1940s-70s,&quot; Mercedes Steedman
* &quot;Spymasters, Spies, and their Subjects: The RCMP and Canadian State Repression, 1914-39,&quot; Gregory S. Kealey
* &quot;In Whose Public Interest? The Canadian Union of Postal Workers and National Security,&quot; Evert Hoogers

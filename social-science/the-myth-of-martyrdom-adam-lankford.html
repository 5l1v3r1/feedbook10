  <title>The Myth of Martyrdom - Adam Lankford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A startling look at the deepest, darkest secrets that terrorists pray you&#39;ll never know&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, experts from the most powerful governments and prestigious universities around the world have told us that suicide bombers are psychologically normal men and women driven by a single-minded purpose: self-sacrifice. As it turns out, this claim originated with the terrorist leaders themselves, who insisted that they would never recruit mentally unstable people to carry out suicide attacks. As these strikes have become both increasingly common and increasingly deadly, no one has challenged this conventional wisdom. These are fearless ideological warriors, we&#39;re told, who have the same resolve and commitment to their beliefs as our own Navy SEALs, because they&#39;re willing to die for the sake of their cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Myth of Martyrdom, &lt;/i&gt;Adam Lankford argues that these so-called experts have it all wrong. The truth is that most suicide terrorists are like any other suicidal person--longing to escape from unbearable pain, be it depression, anxiety, marital strife, or professional failure. Their &quot;martyrdom&quot; is essentially a cover for an underlying death wish. Drawing on an array of primary sources, including suicide notes, love letters, diary entries, and martyrdom videos, Lankford reveals the important parallels that exist between suicide bombers, airplane hijackers, cult members, and rampage shooters. The result is an astonishing account of rage and shame that will transform the way we think of terrorism forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can&#39;t hope to stop these deadly attacks, Lankford argues, until we understand what&#39;s really behind them. This timely and provocative book flips a decades-old argument on its head--and has huge implications for our future.&lt;/p&gt;" />

DEFEAT FEMINIST&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
False Rape Claims: A Men&amp;#39;s Freedom Manifesto&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feminism is a system of guilt very akin to the old Catholic church, or the&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
hypocrisies of Victorian life, or of Mao&amp;#39;s pointless &amp;#39;cultural revolution&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
with it&amp;#39;s little red book waving women cadres chanting fanatically. Only this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
time the common or garden variety of popular feminism functions as a &amp;#39;little&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
purple book&amp;#39;. Only that the chanting remains inane and simplistic and just as&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
pointless.&amp;#39;Equal pay for equal work&amp;#39; which sounds Ok until you add &amp;#39;equal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
conditions&amp;#39;- for mens conditions are often far different; like deep&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
underground, far out to see, longer hours, night time, dark or cold or stormy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
or dangerously unequal conditions (See Dr Warren Farrell for similar answers)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;girls can do anything&amp;#39; (except impregnate a man, or another woman) or the&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
infamous lie we answer here- &amp;#39;rape is about power&amp;#39;.&lt;br /&gt;
Ask This If Rape is about an &amp;#39;all powerful patriarchy&amp;#39; why do men go to jail&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
for it?&lt;br /&gt;
If Rape were about power why are so many men falsely accused of it? Matriarchy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
has all the power when it comes to child custody, length of life and unequal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
sentencing for similar crimes; why not too with rape? This book is one mans&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
answer on one issue long thought under the complete control of the female&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
feminist matriarchy: RAPE Whereby our false accusers dared to call all men&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;rapists&amp;#39; (Susan Brownmiller: &amp;quot;Against Our Will&amp;quot;) This volume is a MASCULIST&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
attack on such bad-mouthing rapist ms- representations in feminist media. Are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
all men really all out rapist fiends as depicted by feminism? And is the only&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
solution to become a wimpy new age &amp;#39;guy&amp;#39;. Think of what a &amp;#39;guy&amp;#39; is, a dupe. a&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
dope with his clothes off. We go way beyond Sommers or Farrell. A guy who&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
thinks sex is &amp;#39;have you done it yet&amp;#39;- this book will make your hair stand on&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
end as it too explores just the beginnings of what real male sexuality could&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
be like..&lt;br /&gt;
The political conclusion to this book also could shock you.&lt;br /&gt;
It is nothing less than the reality based claim of men to power in the public&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
sphere, and thus fully deserving of public respect, privileges and honours..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are men only interested in sex, violence, war, destruction and hatred. As&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
feminism holds. Find out here. Are men only male chauvinism bigots bent on&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
dominating power to overcome women and rape them? All of these images of men&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
are given out by feminism. Is there any truth to those feminist views of men?" />

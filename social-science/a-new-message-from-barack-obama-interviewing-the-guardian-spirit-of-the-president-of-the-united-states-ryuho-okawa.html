  <title>A New Message from Barack Obama: Interviewing the Guardian Spirit of the President of the United States - Ryuho Okawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In April 2014, President Obama embarked on his fifth trip to Asia during his time in office to discuss the pressing issues in the Asia-pacific region. A week before his Asia trip, Master Ryuho Okawa held a spiritual interview with Barack Obama, which revealed his true objectives of his Asia tour and about his thoughts on current affairs in the world. What is President Obama&#39;s vision of America&#39;s role in the world today? Why does he believe that America is not the world&#39;s policeman? This spiritual interview reveals President Obama&#39;s stance on international relations including America&#39;s relationship with China, the Ukraine crisis and Islamic extremism. It also discloses his honest feelings about Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Russian President Putin. Now that America is &quot;on the verge of crisis,&quot; as the guardian spirit of President Obama says in this interview, we all need to think about how we can achieve security, justice and peace in the world without the &quot;world&#39;s policeman.&quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />

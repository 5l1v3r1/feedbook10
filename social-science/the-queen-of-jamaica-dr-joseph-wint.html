  <title>The Queen of Jamaica - Dr. Joseph Wint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Jamaica&lt;br /&gt;
 examines our relationship with the crown and explores the possibilities for our future as a people and that of monarchy in Jamaica. &lt;br /&gt;
It is proposed that now is the time for Jamaica to say good-bye to Britains Queen Elizabeth as our monarch. Before we close this chapter on the British Crown, there are a few questions to consider:&lt;br /&gt;
Are we ready for complete independence? &lt;br /&gt;
Is Jamaica inspired enough to take great strides forward on our own? &lt;br /&gt;
Are we prepared to outline a long-term strategy &lt;br /&gt;
for sustainable development and see it to fruition? &lt;br /&gt;
Can we reform Jamaica from within, to create a powerhouse of progress and prosperity?&lt;br /&gt;
What will happen to Jamaicans who hold British passports? &lt;br /&gt;
What does it mean to be a Jamaican? &lt;br /&gt;
How will separation from the crown affect our identity as a people? &lt;br /&gt;
Will there be unexpected consequences to going it alone?&lt;br /&gt;
Do we really want to be a republic? &lt;br /&gt;
Is this form of government in keeping with our traditions in governance? &lt;br /&gt;
What will be gained by adopting this model for our political future? &lt;br /&gt;
What will be lost by abandoning the monarchy?&lt;br /&gt;
Why not choose to have our own working monarch? &lt;br /&gt;
Have we grown accustomed to having a lofty figurehead to look up to? &lt;br /&gt;
Are our national interests best served by having such a person for the people to focus on as an example of what a fine and upstanding Jamaican should be? &lt;br /&gt;
Would having such a leader that reflects our nation inspire greatness in our people?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A Farm Dies Once a Year - Arlo Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Book of the Month for &lt;i&gt;GQ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Flavorwire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Beautifully told...In this one season of life, Crawford&#39;s writing about the work, people, nature and his family legacy reveals much about a simple life, and reminds us all to appreciate life&#39;s riches.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Seattle Post Intelligencer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A must-read...&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Washington Independent Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intimate, gorgeously observed memoir about family and farming that forms a powerful lesson in the hard-earned risks that make life worth living&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summer he was thirty-one, Arlo Crawford returned home for the summer harvest at New Morning Farm--seventy-five acres tucked in a hollow in south-central Pennsylvania where his parents had been growing organic vegetables for almost forty years.&lt;br&gt;Like many summers before, Arlo returned to the family farm&#39;s familiar rhythms--rise, eat, bend, pick, sort, sweat, sleep. But this time he was also there to change his direction, like his father years ago. In the 1970s, well before the explosion of the farm-to-table and slow food movement, Arlo&#39;s father, Jim, left behind law school and Vietnam, and decided to give farming a try. Arlo&#39;s return also prompts a reexamination of a past tragedy: the murder of a neighboring farmer twenty years before. A chronicle of one full season on a farm, with all its small triumphs and inevitable setbacks, &lt;i&gt;A Farm Dies Once a Year&lt;/i&gt; is a meditation on work--the true nature of it, and on taking pride in it--and a son&#39;s reckoning with a father&#39;s legacy. Above all, it is a striking portrait of how one man builds, sows, and harvests his way into a new understanding of the risks necessary to a life well-lived.&lt;/p&gt;" />

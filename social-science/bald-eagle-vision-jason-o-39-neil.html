  <title>Bald Eagle Vision - Jason O&#39;Neil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    With a pristine nature preserve in western Alaska as a backdrop, a father uses a fishing trip to bond with his daughter and discuss how to solve many of
    Americas most pressing problems. Free from television and social media, the pair enjoys the wilderness while discussing the factors leading to and the
    solutions to the National Debt. With a single topic each day, the duo examines major problems that were never foreseen by the Constitution. On Day One, the
    deterioration of the American Work Ethic is discussed. In my day, we ran to the school bus. Today the students waddle On the Day Two, there is a healthy
    exchange about the growth of the Welfare State and how the Donkey created it, but the Elephant has helped sustain it. On Day Three, there is an in-depth
    discussion about the causes of the National Debt. Finally, on Day Four, specific solutions are provided.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    During this backwoods odyssey, the American Bald Eagle serves as a unifying symbol for the Republic at risk of economic deterioration, perhaps extinction,
    just like this supreme raptor was 40 years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A premise is that the lower work ethic helps bring about the Welfare State that maintains itself at the expensive of the nations citizens and bankrupts
    the nation in the process. One conversation focuses on the causes the fall of the Roman Empire. Another discussion focuses on the impact of the Great
    Society upon the national economy today. Indeed, individual freedoms, such as the ability of the current generation to find a job or later to retire in
    comfort, are lost to an unsustainable national debt that dramatically reduces Americas competitiveness in a global economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The book ends with a call for collective action by Americans on a scale unseen since the Revolution of 1776 in order to change the direction of the

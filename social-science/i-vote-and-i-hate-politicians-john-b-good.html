      <meta name="description" content="This book is essentially a statement about our present state of affairs as seen through the eyes of a common middle class citizen, in what from my viewpoint used to lay claim as the richest and proudest country in the world. I hope if nothing else is conveyed in this work it is this: Our founding fathers fought with their lives to ensure this country was chartered as a democratic, free society run by the people and for the people. They even gave we the people the unalienable right to change the course of government if it ever ceased to represent the values, ideals and freedoms born to all Americans individually. It is all about you and dependent on you to eliminate the problem  Politicians, and be part of the solution  Living in a free democratic society now and for future generations." />

  <title>Humans on the Run - Kumar M. Tiku</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In fleeing sometimes there is freedom, sometimes safety, sometimes sheer survival. Twenty-five individuals in flight, long disconnected from the certitudes of a settled, anchored existence. They map their journeys when moving to the next village, town, city, country, or continent, in the hope of beating certain death, denigration, and abuse. These stories—rather lives—from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Tibet, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, Eritrea, and South Sudan speak of the many effects of international intrigues and the raging fires of ethnic, communal, and religion-based violence on ordinary lives.Humans on the Run is a collection of memories of several microscopic journeys embarked upon by humans, in time and space, compelled by political and sectarian strife. It is about homeless lives and textured human experiences in forced migration, when war and violence consign individuals and families to a lifetime of uncertainty. But it is also about how, in fleeing bombs and battered neighbourhoods, life, hope, and resilience triumph against all odds." />

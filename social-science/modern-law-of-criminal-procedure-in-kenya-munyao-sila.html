  <title>Modern Law of Criminal Procedure in Kenya - Munyao Sila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The law on criminal procedure in Kenya has tremendously changed after the Constitution of Kenya of 2010. New institutions with an impact on the criminal process such as the National Police Service, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Supreme Court were created. Certain rights that were hitherto unavailable were entrenched in the constitution, including the right to bail irrespective of the offence and the right to legal representation. The superior courts have had a busy time in the interpretation of the current law, and groundbreaking jurisprudence has emerged. There is no doubt that the study of criminal procedure has significantly changed. 
This book covers all important aspects of criminal procedure, taking into consideration the changes brought about by the Constitution of 2010. It fills a void created by the lack of updated texts on the law of criminal procedure. It utilizes simple, easy-to-understand language and makes reference to both local and international case law. This book will prove to be an invaluable companion to students of criminal procedure, legal practitioners, researchers, and the general public." />

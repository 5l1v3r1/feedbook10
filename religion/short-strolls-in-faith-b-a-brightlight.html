  <title>Short Strolls in Faith - B. A. Brightlight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Relax your body and let your heart and mind take a pleasant journeya short stroll in faith. Travel along in forty-two separate trips with the writers, who find Gods presence in the ordinary moments of their lives. One author see the imprint of Gods hand in a game of golf, where the endless process of perfecting ones shot is reminiscent of the never-ending struggle to rid oneself of sin. Another recalls childhood stories and the unconditional trust that children tend to place in their friends, knowing that this is the very same kind of trust they must strive to place in God. A third author describes the difficult journey of being diagnosed with terminal cancer and compares it to a cab ride with the Lord and the amazing peace that he has in his heart to trust Godwhether He takes him to his home or Gods home. Short Strolls in Faith offers insightful and humorous commentary of applying the tenets of scripture into everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its virtually impossible not to recognize oneself in these homespun stories of Christians connecting with God as they go about the ordinary business of living their lives as the authors speak with voices that should make readers feel right at home.&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>The Last Man Stand and Walk the Green Mile - Firebird Green Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To my fellow martyrs, get yourself ready, your companion in the word and brother in the spirit Firebird Green Jr. is right back at you for the second time in two years, and he did not arrive at your number by mistake or on the magic carpet either, because it had outlasted its usefulness, retired and placed in storage with all the other outdated furniture for a better Promise that is in the high calling in Christ Jesus, the only begotten son of the most high God, who is a constant companion of the brethren and the keeper of all hope. The last time you heard from me, the magic carpet had me here and there, taken me on some very wild rides. I felt, at times, like I was riding on the back of Haley comet, after the tail had been cut off by the rings of Saturn! Listen in, audience, a female veteran that I know purchased and reviewed one of my first book, The Last Man Is Standing, and this is what she had to say: The book is interesting but you were all over the place. And make no mistake about it, she was right. I was all over the world. Listen in, saints, the Lord reflected light into my spirit on January 13, 2013, after I had been burned, pretty badly, on January 1, 2013, with a class 2 burn to the left Leg and foot, when I was attempting to cook the traditional New Years Day dinner! In the southern part of the nation, black-eyed peas and cabbages, and for the next three months, when I got up and said my morning prayer, with my leg elevated and extended, I would always add this, If not today, Lord maybe, tomorrow, and after two months, it finally started to grow a scab. After that, I knew it would not take long. Prayer had been answered and healing was on the way.
In the Last Man Is Standing, God Told me to tell the whole truth about the past life that I had lived and hold back nothing, tell the good, the bad, and the ugly because it has everything to do about him. And it is his mercy and grace that endures forever. Amen. And that is what I tried to do, but now, after the life sentence that I received from God, in my last book, well, now in the The Last Man Stand and Walk the Green Mile, the sentence is death. So come along with me down the corridor of life and witness me being drawn through the passageway to my long way home, and you are welcome to join anytime. Come along! You are guaranteed not to be disappointed, and the blessing will abound." />

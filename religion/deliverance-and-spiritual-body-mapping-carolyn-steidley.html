  <title>Deliverance and Spiritual Body Mapping - Carolyn Steidley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will you go to hell for me? asked the Lord. I remember standing in my living room stunned. It took me a few days to be able to answer him. I replied with a shaking, Yes. He then took me in a vision to the gates of hell. I could smell the sulfur and feel the heat. The gates were huge thick black iron, they swung open as I approached. I was standing on stepping stones just big enough for my feet and lava swirled around the stones. I heard the Lords voice, Dont be afraid Carolyn. I have a net around you and yours. I looked and saw a large net all around me. I continued along the stones and then I saw it - a hand reached desperately to me out of the lava. I grabbed a hold and pulled for all I was worth! The vision ended. From that vision, I learned there are people all around us who are in the own personal hells. We are to set the captives free! The Lord gave me a way to help. It is called Spiritual Body Mapping and it works! It is an amazing way to quickly diagnose and target the strengths as well as areas that need to be addressed in an individuals life. As you read this book, I pray for the spirit of wisdom and revelation to enlighten you. God Bless you, Carolyn Steidley" />

  <title>Fervent and Effective Prayers - Rev. Dr. Kwame O. Lartey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This  book, &quot;Frevent And Effective Prayers For Every Day In The Week, From Sunday To Saturday,&quot; was inspired by the Holy Spirit to transform and renew lives, change attitudes, redirect wrong motives, empower believers to develop blameless and guiltless consciences and wholesome and effective spiritual life styles, through a serious and sincere daily examination of the bleievers conscience, attitudes, motives and lifestyles.  This model is based on Psalm 139:23&amp;24, where David prays:&quot;Search me O God and know my thoughts.  Point out anything in me that offends You, and lead me along the path of everlasting life.&quot; (NLT).
 It is a book that will help us not to live to ourselves, nor pursue our own desires, nor to please ourselves to the detrement of others, but to live to the will and pleasure of God.  It is a book that will help us &quot;be crucified unto the world and the world curcified unto to us,&quot; be resurrected with Christ to reign and rule with Him, seated at the Right Hand of God in Heaven.  It is a book that will help us all believers who use it daily experience the truth:  &quot;Christ is in you, the hope of glory&quot; (Gal.2:19&amp;20; 6:14&amp;15 Col. 1:27)
I believe it is a book meant for the times in which we live.  A time of turbalence, violence, frustration, dispair and hopelessness, for both the young and the old.  The person who prays these prayers daily and consistently will experience calmness in the face of fear, empowerment and victory over the problems of this world." />

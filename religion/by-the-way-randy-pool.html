  <title>By the Way - Randy Pool</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By the Way is an in-depth Bible study of the final discourse of Jesus contained in John 1417 before His passion. It highlights the dual relationship that we have in Him and He in us. It expounds on not only the home in heaven He is preparing for us but also the home in us we are preparing for Him. It examines the person and work of the Holy Spirit as He relates to our Divine relationship with the Son. It looks at what it means to pray in Jesuss name, what is eternal life, and the purpose for which God saved us.
By the Way is designed to be a foundation for discipleship and can be easily understood by new believers and easily transferred to those they lead to Christ. It began as a simple study to explain to internationals without a strong foundation in scripture what it meant to be a Christian. It was later shared in church settings as a personal ministry of the author. This book gives opportunity for the message to be carried farther.
By the Way is a primer for every new believer in Jesus Christ. Taken from His own words at the close of His ministry on earth, I believe these are four of the most important chapters from the teachings of Christ. I believe you will find the principles basic, solid, and liberating as you endeavor to be the Christian you have become." />

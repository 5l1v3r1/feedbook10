  <title>Sin and the Church - Crystal Maria Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sin and the Church: Perspectives and Principles for Powerful Christian Living is a timely message for today.  This book is born out of Crystal Scott&#39;s own personal Christian experience and journey, and is a reflection of God&#39;s grace, patience, and providence; she discloses that while forever a work-in-progress, she has received revelation and understanding through her relationship with God that affords her the opportunity to enlighten others as she has been enlightened.  
WHAT YOU DON&#39;T KNOW CAN HURT...!
As related to the issue of Sin and the Church, I consider this more than a mere clich:  what you don&#39;t know can indeed hurt you; and this hurt is more and more apparent in the Church, which is the body of Christ (His believers and followers).  There is a rapid increase of spiritual decline in the Church that is quite alarming and its impact is far-reaching.  All too often there seems to be very little difference between Church people and those who do not claim to be followers of Christ.  I contend, without apology, that there is an expectation of the Church that God has, which is not being carried out as it should be.
In the face of what seems gloom and doom for the Church, God raises a word of enlightenment and encouragement.  God knows there are some who are innocently led astray by erroneous doctrine and confused, and He cares.  He also cares about those who innocently or deceptively lead others astray and He offers grace, forgiveness, and restoration to the repentant heart.  Included in this book are the following:
	True Christian Doctrine
	Lifestyles that are not indicative of Christianity and holiness
	Essential keys for powerful Christian living
	Statistical Data 
	Personal testimonies and interviews
	And much more
SIN AND THE CHURCH:  PERSPECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES FOR POWERFUL CHRISTIAN LIVING...GOOD NEWS in confusing and troubled times!" />

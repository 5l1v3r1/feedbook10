  <title>The Names of God Journal - Chinedu Okoye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This journal gives you 366 lined pages to record your thoughts, feelings, goals, dreams and testimonies throughout the year. No more scrap notes lying about your library, study or work area. No more lost or misplaced journals half way through the year. 
It is designed to bring you directly under the canopy of the powerful presence of God. With a different name or attribute of God each day of the year, you will surely delight yourself in learning and mastering new names of your creator. Using the journal daily, you find yourself before the timeless, uncontainable, and unlimited God. &lt;br&gt; 
Use this journal along with your daily bible study to record the revelations you receive, your understanding of the revelations, and your prayer petitions. &lt;br&gt;
On January 1, record your New Year resolutions, initial prayer points, and goals for the year. On December 31, go back and reflect on your unique journey and discover a new sense of Gods faithful presence. &lt;br&gt;
Not strictly for the religious and individuals interested in knowing and praying the names of God, this journal is also useful to people doing academic work, to business executives, bible scholars and regular journal keepers. &lt;br&gt;" />

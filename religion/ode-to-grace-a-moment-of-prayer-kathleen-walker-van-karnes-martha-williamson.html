  <title>Ode to Grace a Moment of Prayer - Kathleen Walker Van Karnes, Martha Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;San Marino Community Church seeks to provide the language of faith to those who participate in its ministries. Kathy has both learned and embraced that language. This book of prayers for our choir is a treasure. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In many ways, music provides the soundtrack for the churchs goal promoting unity. There is but one melody, although people of differing genders, ages, ethnicities, experiences, educations and backgrounds sing it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We agree with the expression, Those who sing, pray twice. Kathy has more than found her own voice in prayer. She has collected the voices of others and incorporated them in her prayers recited at the end of choir practice. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a result, the choir quite literally pray twice when they first sing, then reflect through the prayers of Kathy. Enjoy Ode to Grace. I certainly do! &lt;br /&gt;

Kathys lovely prayers have been an integral part of our Chancel Choir rehearsals for so many years, its hard to imagine rehearsal without them. Her prayers are thoughtful, inspirational, and comforting. I fully endorse this wonderful collection celebrating Grace. She lifts us up! &lt;br /&gt;

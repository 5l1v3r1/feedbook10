  <title>World&#39;s End - Siseko Kumbi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take a journey with Sibusiso, Paul, Refiloe, and Zechariah. They are four individuals living different lives. Yet they dont know that heaven has great plans for them. They also dont know that the dark kingdom does too.
The multi-billionaire Sibusiso Khumalo grapples with his spirituality while his partner, Refiloe Chabedi  a journalist with a passion for adventure, struggles to stay alive. Paul Damas is a free-lance writer with immense financial problems. His wife Charmaine, a medical doctor, tries to support him as a good wife should. Zechariah, a clergyman, and member of the Order of Freemasons is doubting his course and seeks a way out of the prison he placed himself in. All their personal struggles, all their strife leads them to one great event which changes their lives. Each of them has a special role to play in the final hours of the worlds history. All around them a war is taking place. In the place that eyes dont see, where hands cannot touch, there are battles fought for their very lives.
The Dark Sun is rising and it seems nothing can stop it. The devil and his minions seem to be getting their way. But the forces of righteousness will not let them gain victory. Heaven is gathering up a few to lead many out of darkness into light  true light. The whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now (Romans 8:22) under the weight of sin and its results, but the Son of is coming to banish all darkness. When He comes He will usher in an era of light." />

  <title>Soulzer - P.I. Sabbathi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is it your aim to grow in God? Let it grow, as a small flame grows into a fire (2 Timothy 1:6, NCV). Is your soul prospering in the Lord? The apostle John wishes his readers: Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers (3 John 2). Your spiritual growth is a choice. Soulzer fortifies every Christian who is truly fond of progressing in Christlike character by imitating Him even when no one is watching. To become a man after Gods own heart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detach yourself from the evil desires of the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this self-denial - sanctify the Lord God in your hearts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Gods power we live and move and exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize the Lord by feeling His presence with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become a temple of God as the Spirit of God dwells in you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let the people around you taste the fruit of the Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep on growing into the whole measure of all the fullness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of Christ and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue your soul soldiering until Christ is formed in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, I have conquered the world! (John 16:33, NRSV). A Christian is a lifelong fighter. Everyone who has been fathered by God conquers the world. This is the conquering power that has conquered the world: our faith (1 John 5:4, NET). Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us (Romans 8:37). Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ (2 Corinthians 2:14). As the victory is from the Lord (Proverbs 21:31, NET) you need to fight against sin (Hebrews 12:4, BBE), and keep on conquering the D-evil. This is a conquerable combat. You can certainly accomplish a victory over sin for He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4). Practice Christliness and become a Christ at heart!&lt;/p&gt;" />

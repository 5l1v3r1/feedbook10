  <title>A Pastor&#39;s Guide to Conducting a Funeral - Greg F. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Pastors Guide to Conducting a Funeral: Things Every Pastor Needs to Know, But May Have Been Afraid to Ask&lt;/i&gt; gives pastors, chaplains, and other caregivers clear and concise guidance for responding to the profound needs of people facing the deaths of loved ones. It is a tool that every ministry student and pastor can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory F. Jackson, senior pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church in Camden, Ohio, has shared over two hundred funerals with the people of his rural community during the past seventeen years. These experiences shape the books research and guide its practical and timely advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young pastors may wonder, What should I say and do at the funeral home or at the grave? What will help families face their losses with faith and trust in God? Older pastors might ask, How can I refresh my ministry at the time of death? No matter what stage of ministry you find yourself in, this book can be your companion. It can help you when you are uncertain about the best approach to a familys grief or when you need insight into to a familys special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book that every pastor needs to read. Each chapter includes results of surveys of pastors and funeral directors and ends with a short list of insights pastors need to know to serve more compassionately and effectively. As an added bonus, the book concludes with A Bakers Dozen of Funeral Director Nuggets, sharing the most important tips funeral directors wished pastors knew about how to lead thoughtful funeral services with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My friend Greg Jackson has given every pastor not only a guide for conducting funerals, but a gift!  His personal and practical insights will assist us in ministering to the hurting.  THIS is a winner!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Roswell Street Baptist Church
&lt;br&gt;Marietta, Georgia&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conducting A Funeral&lt;/u&gt; is a must read for every pastor.  Pastor Greg Jackson offers so many helpful tips on how a pastor can effectively and intentionally minister to families who are dealing with death.  I believe you will also find, as I did, the chapter on the importance of the pastors relationship with a funeral director to be especially helpful.  As important as this moment of ministry is in the lives of those trying to make sense of the painful reality of death, it is vital that every pastor be prepared.  This book is very well written and will assist both the novice as well as the experienced pastor in maximizing their effectiveness in ministry.  I recommend you read it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;center&gt; Dr. Michael Landry , Senior Pastor, Sarasota Baptist Church&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you Greg!!!  Your honesty, compassion, and obvious wisdom as a Senior Pastor at the same church for an extended number of years comes through on every page!  Funerals and death are always a challenge, even for the most seasoned pastor.  Thus, I whole-heartedly recommend this book for any person in ministry, especially if you are just starting out!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

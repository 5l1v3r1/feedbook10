  <title>Sermons by Jonathan Edwards on the Matthean Parables, Volume II: Divine Husbandman (On the Parable of the Sower and the Seed) - Ken Minkema, Adriaan C. Neele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This second volume of Sermons by Jonathan Edwards on the Matthean Parables contains a previously unpublished series of six sermons by Edwards on Jesus&#39; parable of the Sower and the Seed, as found in Matthew 13:3-7. Edwards preached these sermons in 1740 immediately following the visit of George Whitefield to Edwards&#39; church in Northampton, Massachusetts, in October of that year. Not only does this series have a historical significance for its place in the Great Awakening, but it contains important pronouncements on the preacher&#39;s craft and the hearer&#39;s responsibilities. These sermons have been placed in the context of Edwards&#39; preaching style and method, and framed by historical considerations. Prepared from the original manuscripts by the staff of the Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University, this series represents a significant addition to the available Edwards corpus that will be of interest to scholars, religious leaders, and general readers." />

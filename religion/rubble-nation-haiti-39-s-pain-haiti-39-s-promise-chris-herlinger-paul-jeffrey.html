  <title>Rubble Nation: Haiti&#39;s Pain, Haiti&#39;s Promise - Chris Herlinger, Paul Jeffrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As in their previous book, Where Mercy Fails: Darfur&#39;s Struggle to Survive, Chris Herlinger and Paul Jeffrey fuse narrative and photographs to put a human face on the massive suffering that Haiti has experienced and continues to experience since the earthquake in January 2010. A subject of special interest in the Episcopal Church, which is committed to rebuilding the church in Haiti. A work of photo-journalism that gives immediacy to the story of the ongoing catastrophe in Haiti. There is a 72-page color insert Chris&#39;s text tells the story of post-quake Haiti through interviews with Haitian citizens and aid managers. Each interview adds a layer to our understanding of the suffering of the people and of the heroic efforts to ameliorate that suffering. The narrative is set in the context of the country&#39;s history and the Haitian government&#39;s effort to repair and rebuild their nation. Paul&#39;s photographs capture images not only of individuals struggling to survive, but also of the innate dignity and generosity that arises in the midst of the struggle. Questions for discussion are included in the book along with an interview with the authors." />

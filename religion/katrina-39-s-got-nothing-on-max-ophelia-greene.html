  <title>Katrina&#39;s Got Nothing on Max - Ophelia Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever encountered a storm and wondered how will you survive? Ophelia R. Greene has captured ten heart wrenching true stories of storm encounters of the Prescott family set in rural Louisiana. The characters share their storm encounters with Hurricane Max. Hurricane Max did not make national or world news, but Katrina&#39;s got nothing on Max. Max. You might say he was this family&#39;s &quot;Katrina.&quot; Sometimes when Katrinas or Maxes come into our lives -and stay- we think we are surely going to drown. Sometimes we want to drown. It is just too hard to keep kicking to stay afloat or find a safe place. We can’t seem to avoid the debris all around us, and it would be easier just to let the darn storm blow us out to sea or bury us under a pile of mud, slush, or debris. This is a true story of a vicious of mental and physical abuse, likened to being caught daily in a constant super storm; but it is also a story of hope, redemption, forgiveness, and the presence of God. Come on this journey with the Prescott family as they experience life in a constant super storm. Perhaps by reading this story you can find encouragement and hope, even in the middle of your super storm." />

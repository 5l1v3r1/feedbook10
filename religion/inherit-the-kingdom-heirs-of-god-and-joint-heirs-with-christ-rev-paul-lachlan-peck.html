  <title>Inherit the Kingdom: Heirs of God and Joint Heirs with Christ - Rev. Paul Lachlan Peck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Only you know what roads you have traveled, what burdens you have borne. You alone know what experiences you have had to bring you to this book You can do whatever it is that you must do with your life, beginning right here and right now. Sharing fifty years of knowledge and experience in spiritual healing, Reverend Peck offers a new realm of possibilities for obtaining better health, a greater sense of wealth, and a feeling of brotherly love. He tackles the difficult topics of establishing a working relationship between God and man and overcoming the evils and temptations in life. Many of Reverend Pecks controversial ideasas well as his startling approach for the reorganization of the churchdemand the readers open-mindedness and attention. Reverend Peck effectively guides the reader through a step-by-step approach to the various aspects concerning spiritual healing and the many ways of practicing Jesus teachings in our daily lives. Paul Lachlan Peck is an ordained minister and family counselor and teacher of New Age theology. He has spent more than fifty years practicing spiritual healing, thirty-five of those years he spent healing by the laying on of hands." />

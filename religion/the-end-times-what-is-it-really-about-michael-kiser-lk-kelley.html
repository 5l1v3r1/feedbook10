  <title>The End Times - What Is It Really About? - Michael Kiser, Lk Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The End Times&quot; spotlights the many stories that are spread all throughout the world. Religions focus on this one aspect, but does not, in any way, depict the END of The World. This book attempts to dissect these aspects, and to put forth that the &quot;End Times&quot; are really about the change of thought, while also proving that the doom and gloom being taught is incorrect. It also attempts to prove that it will not be brought about in the year 2012. It is &#39;my&#39; sincere, desire within my soul to bring forth that the knowledge of what we &quot;think&quot; we possess is not the truth, even within the vast universe. There are, literally, thousands of stories that have been hidden from us by all but a select few, while repeating the Biblical Story of Adam and Eve in every corner of the Earth. In fact, many of these same stories also exist within many different religions around the world." />

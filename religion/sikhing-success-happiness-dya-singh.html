  <title>Sikhing Success &amp; Happiness - Dya Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no doubt, that ones environment, upbringing, family stability, health, job satisfaction, and even living in the right country contributes towards ones success &amp; happiness. But beyond all that, it all starts with being in an ever-present uplifted positive state of mind, and being in touch with ones inner self. So, understanding ones own mind, regular self analysis and looking within, are triggers for outward progress in life, success and happiness.
Dya Singh has provided some insights on this subject from his diverse background. He is of north Indian (Punjabi) origin, born into a Sikh family (his father was a spiritual minstrel and teacher) and was brought up in multicultural Malaysia. He was educated in English and has spent all his adult life in England and Australia.
He has, over the last 25 years, taken his musical group around the globe singing in his native Gurmukhi and espousing the truths towards a better life to mainstream (mainly western) and Sikh audiences / congregations. 
Within this book are some startling secrets to help anyone towards success and happiness." />

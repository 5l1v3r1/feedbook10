  <title>Truth &amp; Love - Pastor Jordan Biel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why is it that nonbelievers have a misconception of God? Why is it that so many believers either believe God to be truth or love? Is it possible that they are one and the same? Is it possible that Jesus is both truth and love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a dynamic young emerging leader of his day and prophetic voice in this generation, Jordan Biel has done his diligence on this much-needed topic. He invites us to a greater experience with the God who is throughout every aspect of both love and truth. He takes us beyond words to the heart of the matter  where God lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Founder of Eagles Wings, Musician, Bishop Robert Stearns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jordan Biel is maybe the most talented person I know, and now his creativity has been able to find a home in written form. Jordans passion comes through on every page. He has a breadth of experience few others have. He has seen the Kingdom from every possible angle and has an important word for the 21st century church in this book. His insights, illustrations, and humor will make you not want to put it down.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A Crown of His Loving Kindness - Bernard Leong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like  a  simmering  stream  in  the hot, barren,  and  dry desert,  flowing				from the oasis, giving life to the cool Palm trees, so providing a 			refreshing haven,  for nomads &amp; their flocks: Or like starlight and moonlight 			under the big canopy of dark nights ! So  it  is  with  the Supernatural  	and  the Miracles of God,  making their presence felt, from the inception of 			Man,  since Adam and Eve, in the Splendor of  the Garden of  Eden ! 
	The relationship between God the Mankind, continued despite Adam&#39;s 				Fall; God still yearned for us, spanning rainbows over the Sky  
	 saying, I Love you, culminating in His  sending Jesus Christ, His Son 
		to a cruel death on the Cross, redeeming us from the penalty of 
	 our sins 2000  years&#39; ago! 
	Now, we are made right with God, reconnected and  having  fellowship
		with Him, and with one another! At times He intervened in Nations 
	and individuals alike, stoking the fires of Spiritual Renewals, as  the Light  
		is  low, and  the Fire of Love and Zeal is waning!
	It is not surprising therefore, when God, moves Supernaturally and in the 			Miraculous in our lives, when we call upon Him in earnest, as in a 
	crisis! He says,I will never leave you nor forsake you (Hebrews13:5b) ! 			And, as if  to dispel any lingering doubt  or fear, again God  says: 
	  	     GO!  therefore into All the World.....and  LO!  I Am 
		        With  you always, even unto the Ends of The Earth!

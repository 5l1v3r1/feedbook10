  <title>Play with Fire - Bianca Juarez Olthoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw, real, and relatable, this book is your guide to navigating life&#39;s fires. Bianca Olthoff is here to show that our struggles and hardships may be the fire that refines us instead of destroys us, brings us hope instead of despair, and leads us right into the arms of a God who loves us.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play with Fire,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the debut book by popular speaker and teacher Bianca Juarez Olthoff,&amp;nbsp;is the reminder that God isn&#39;t waiting until you have more resources or a spouse or a job so he can use you. He&#39;s ready to use you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the mythical creature, the Phoenix, which was also referenced by early church leaders, she parallels this story with God&#39;s work in her own life, highlighting the beauty of reinvention with fire as both the impetus and the method for change.&amp;nbsp;Olthoff reminds us that we serve a God who is redemptive and can take the worst situations and use them for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play With Fire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Bible-infused message that will help women discover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way out of the middle is moving forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal and powerful nature of the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power and sacrifice of transformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique calling and purpose of life involves transformation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Olthoff&#39;s distinct style, strong storytelling gifts, and powerful bible teaching,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Play with Fire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will remind readers that God has huge dreams for them. In Bianca&#39;s words, &quot;He&#39;s whispering in the wind and speaking through the fire and shouting in silence the extraordinary dream He is birthing in you. His dream for you is far greater than the dream you have for yourself. It&#39;s not your identity or income or influence that will make this happen. Like Zechariah 4:6 says, &quot;&#39;It&#39;s not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,&#39; says the Lord.&quot; It&#39;s time to play&amp;nbsp;with fire.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study guide and video study also available.&lt;/p&gt;" />

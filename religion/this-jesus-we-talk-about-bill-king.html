  <title>This Jesus We Talk About - Bill King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How would you answer questions about the Christian faith? In this book a doubter, whom the author named Thomas, asks many of the common questions that can lead to a resistance in accepting the Christian faith.  Thomas friend ,named Matt (who relates thoughts, understandings, and experiences of the author), writes his answers in the form of letters back to Thomas.  The author writes of a God that is gracious, forgiving, accepting, and ever loving.  And he explores what it is like to be in continuous fellowship with God through Jesus Christ  It is a fellowship free for the asking, a gift waiting to be given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an invitation to be Gods friend.  Before you accept such an invitation you may want to know  more about the God doing the inviting!  The book presents God as a loving father who wants us to come home.  Discover the love and grace of God thought Jesus Christ, a love that will draw you into that intimate friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;   LAWRENCE GERATY, Ph.D. President Emeritus, La Sierra University  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend THIS JESUS WE TALK ABOUT.  It is a theologically sound exploration of many of the most common questions concerning the Christian faith.  The authors lifetime search for a living faith is evident as he explores the answers to questions that would challenge a faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;   LELAND YIALELIS, M.Div. from Andrews Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;
Bill King is a man of faith and intellect, the convergance of those two make this book a must read
     HAROLD WATKINS, Attorney at Law
THIS JESUS WE TALK ABOUT explores  experiences within this broken world that present questions, doubts, and struggles.  The author shows the value of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that brings meaning, healing, and belonging resulting in a loving relationship with Jesus Christ, others, and oneself.
     STEPHEN DANIEL, Ph.D. Clinical Psychology from Biola University
I heartily recommend Bill Kings book.  He writes with a lucid style and every page is brimming with insights into an authentic faith.  Grace triumphs in This Jesus!  Read it and be blessed!

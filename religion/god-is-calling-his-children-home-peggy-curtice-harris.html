  <title>God Is Calling His Children Home - Peggy Curtice Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Their mission was almost completed. Spoke President George W. Bush in the memorial service for the shuttle crew of Columbia STS 107 when these seven astronauts were lost on re-entry on that bright clear morning of February 8, 2003. The world watched and re-watched the havoc in the sky over Texas as before their eyes the space ship disintegrated. They were so close to home. They had done their work and were looking forward to being re-united with their loved ones.
***
The gospel mission is almost completed. The Savior gave His followers the command to go to all the earth. Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them my disciples: baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And I will be with you always, to the end of the age. Matthew 28:19, 20 Good News Bible.
This is what this book is about. These are stories of those who have heard, how they respond and how we are accomplishing The Mission. It is hoped that the reader will recognize just how you have been led by the Holy Spirit to fulfill your gospel commission." />

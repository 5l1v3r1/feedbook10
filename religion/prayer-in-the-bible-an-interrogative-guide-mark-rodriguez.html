  <title>Prayer in the Bible:  an Interrogative Guide - Mark Rodriguez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every mention of prayer in the Bible contains some significant bit of information. &lt;em&gt;In Prayer in the Bible: An Interrogative Guide&lt;/em&gt;, you can find it all, from who prayed what to where and when it was prayed to why and how the prayers were uttered. Also included is a list of every time a prayer was answered in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth volume of the Bible Prayers Series, including &lt;em&gt;Gods Book of Prayers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lords Prayers&lt;/em&gt; both containing all the prayers of the Bible. &lt;em&gt;Gods Book of Prayers&lt;/em&gt; separates every prayer into one of nine categories for convenient reading, while The Lords Prayers lists them in biblical sequence, with an exhaustive concordance of major words or phrases. Volume three of the series, &lt;em&gt;Bible Prayer Pray-ers&lt;/em&gt;, shows the references for all the prayers and every pray-er in the Bible within three separate lists: pray-er sequence, biblical sequence, and category sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prayer series seeks to help you to easily be able to find and pray using Gods own words and ways. Most of us already use the Lords Prayer, so why not use all of the Lords prayers? See these books at
www.GodsBookOfPrayers.com for all of Gods prayers and all things prayerand be a Bible prayer pray-er!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gods Book of Prayers of the Bible Prayers Series&lt;/eM&gt; is a must-have for those who really want to enhance their passion and expression of love for God through prayer.&lt;br /&gt;

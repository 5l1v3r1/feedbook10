  <title>“Have You Wondered?” - Ross Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ross Holmes was born in St. Petersburg, Florida 1921. Born from above at 21, he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ many years and was led to record what he had learned from the Bible. He asked the Lord, Who ever heard of me? Im a nobody. Yet he decided to leave his writings with the Lord to do as He pleased with them.
An aeronautical engineering student, he joined the Army Air Corps when WWII started and became an Instructor Pilot for B-24s. He was saved through the witness of his landlady while stationed in Waco, Texas in 1942. With an avid interest in the Bible, Brother Ross was led to attend Bob Jones University after the war to study Greek and Hebrew.
After graduation, Mr. Holmes was called to the mission field and was led to St. Vincent, BWI in 1952, and was instrumental in starting the Baptist Bible College of the Caribbean. It has been in operation since 1958. A passion for souls also led him to Dominica and Madagascar.
On one of his returns from the mission field in 1959, Bible classes were taught, leading to the eventual organization of Central Baptist Church in Eden, NC; at the same time, he was called by the Lord to found a church in Logtown, Va. while also ministering to inmates in Rockingham County Jail. During his latter years, the prison ministry in Winston-Salem was among his top priorities after moving there.
Before going home to be with the Lord, 2010, most of Ross Holmes days were spent reading and studying Gods Word in Greek, Hebrew and English. He believed and applied Acts 17:11: searching the Scriptures daily whether those things were so. And Isa. 1:18, Come now, and let us REASON together, saith the Lord . . . ." />

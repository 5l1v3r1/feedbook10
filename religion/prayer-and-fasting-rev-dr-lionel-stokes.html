  <title>Prayer and Fasting - Rev. Dr. Lionel Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a conversation with God, then you need to do two things: pray and fast. In this primer focusing on these fundamental activities of faith, Rev. Dr. Lionel Stokes shares her transforming life experiences, exploring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	what the Bible says about prayer;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	why there are so many misconceptions about fasting; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	how fasting and praying interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True prayer is a conversation with God, but many think of it as a monologue because of the way it occurs in church. Its often like a one-way telephone conversation, in which one person goes on endlessly without the slightest pause for even an aha from the other partyand then the caller hangs up before a response can be made. Whatever our circumstances or situations, there are times when we want or need to communicate with God or to hear from Him. The means by which we do this, therefore, must be simple and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a real conversation with God and develop a stronger relationship, with Him, then praying and fasting are the answersbut you need to do it right. Take a balanced approach thats safe and effective, and move closer to the Lord with Prayer and Fasting.&lt;/p&gt;" />

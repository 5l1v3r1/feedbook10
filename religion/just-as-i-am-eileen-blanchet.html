It is his choice to come now as he promised, in spirit, to bring comfort to humanity. It was my choice to work with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is beyond the church; beyond religion; beyond the man Jesus. He encompasses intelligence, intellect, rationality, understanding beyond that which would confine him. Once, it is said, he spoke these words, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.

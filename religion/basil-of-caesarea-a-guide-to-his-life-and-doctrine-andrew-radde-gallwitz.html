  <title>Basil of Caesarea: A Guide to His Life and Doctrine - Andrew Radde-Gallwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Studying the early church can feel like entering a maze of bishops, emperors, councils, and arcane controversies. This book introduces early Christian theology by focusing on one particularly influential figure, Basil of Caesarea (ca. AD 330-378). It views Basil against the backdrop of a Roman Empire that was adopting Christianity. In Basil&#39;s day, Christians were looking for unity in the teaching and practice of their faith. This study acquaints the student with Basil&#39;s brilliant--and often neglected--theological writings. In particular, Saint Basil&#39;s reflections on the Trinity emerge from these pages as fascinating and illuminating testimonies to the faith of early Christians." />

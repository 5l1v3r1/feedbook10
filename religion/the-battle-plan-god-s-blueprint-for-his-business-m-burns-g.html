  <title>The Battle Plan: God’S Blueprint for His Business - M Burns, G</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship is a battle! Faith is a battle! Bridging the two together is an even bigger battle! How do you bridge the gap between your plan and Gods will? Listen attentively. Hearken diligently. Run to His voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be forewarned: You are about to embark in a learning experience that may well oppose mans traditional opinion of running a successful business. But thats the point, to forgo our opinions in lieu of Gods infallible ways. The Battle Plan is not hyper-spiritual, nor is it hyper-carnal, but its the incredible testimony of how God can turn nothing into something if you will just trust His plans concerning you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to build your business on Biblical principles from those who have been through the trenches of starting, growing, and maintaining their own faith-based company. Trenches is an understatement. Its not easy, but it is possible. Its not all about products, procedures, and marketing. It is about the ABCs of faith: Action, Belief, and Confidence. Gods Word is forever settled in heaven. What He promised, He is well able to do through you and through your business despite what the circumstances look like.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your journey, whatever your business, The Battle Plan is sure to have an impact on you naturally, spiritually, and certainly financially. It is broken down into five easy to understand pillars: Building Relationships, Seed Time and Harvest, Product Knowledge, Disciplined Actions, and Flee Idleness.&lt;/p&gt;" />

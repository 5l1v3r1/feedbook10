  <title>Understanding Attitudes to Personhood, Illness, and Death in America&#39;s Multireligious Neighborhoods - Lucinda Mosher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this interfaith book Lucinda Mosher investigates different understandings of destiny, loss, death, and remembrance in America&#39;s many religions. Using stories and interviews with a variety of religious adherents and health professionals, the book wrestles with questions such as: How can our religion guide us in making decisions about certain kinds of medical treatment options? What religion-related issues would it be helpful for a healthcare provider to know? How do different religious traditions help manage our grief?
In a globalized society religious traditions sit alongside each other as never before, and the need for religious literacy and multifaith chaplaincy is increasingly recognized. By looking at multireligious America, this book provides an essential exploration of different attitudes to death, helping members of all faith communities to become more literate with each other&#39;s religious traditions." />

  <title>Resurrected?: An Atheist and Theist Dialogue - Habermas, Flew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth is the central tenet of the Christian faith. St. Paul put it succinctly: if Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is in vain. This remarkable dialogue between the leading Christian scholar of the Resurrection and the world&#39;s best-known philosophical atheist resulted from a three-hour discussion on a popular religious television talk show, moderated by John Ankerberg.   The dialogue began with both participants agreeing to 12 separate historical facts that occurred when Jesus died and shortly afterward. Habermas and Flew then explored how each of their perspectives could account for what happened. Flew offered a psychological thesis interpreting the biblical accounts in natural terms. Habermas supported the historicity of the Resurrection by using contemporary critical methods. The discussion goes on to examine subjects such as medical details regarding crucifixion, extra-biblical sources for Jesus, the Jesus Seminar, St. Paul&#39;s conversion experience and his contribution to the early Christian testimony.   The interchange is marked by mutual respect and exceptional clarity of thought and expression. This is a book that will appeal to a wide audience of believers, seekers, and non-believers. The topic is timely,the participants renowned, and the presentation inviting to both scholar and layperson." />

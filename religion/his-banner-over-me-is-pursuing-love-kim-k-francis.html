  <title>His Banner over Me Is Pursuing Love - Kim K. Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian, do you know that you are the pure, righteous, and holy bride of Christ, and your Spiritual Bridegroom only has eyes for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain may be going&lt;em&gt;tilt-tilt&lt;/em&gt;after reading that statement, but its completely true! Jesus Christ longs for you to personally experience His cherishing love and exuberant life in your Monday-through-Sunday living. He knows that as you enjoy His lavishing, unconditional love, you wont be able to help but express it in this world. The secret to loving is living loved in Christ, your Spiritual Bridegroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Banner Over Me Is Pursuing Love&lt;/em&gt;is the first of three intimate and interactive six-week studies of the Song of Solomon, an allegory describing the divine romance between Christ and His bride, the church. Spanning chapters 1 and 2, this premier installment will help you renew your mind with the following refreshing and liberating truths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As the bride of Christ, you are completely forgiven for the sins of your lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
 Through Christs finished work on the cross and your identification with Him in His crucifixion and resurrection, you have been made brand-new, and Christ is now your very life.&lt;br /&gt;
 The new covenant made in Christs blood has forever sealed you in Him. Your Spiritual Bridegroom will never leave you nor forsake you, regardless of what you do or dont do.&lt;br /&gt;
 Because of His grace, you are free from law-based living to be completely enamored with Christ alone.&lt;br /&gt;
 You have a real, invisible enemy who is trying everything within his limited power to hoodwink you into accepting his lies about who you are. Once you learn his most effective strategy, you will be armed and dangerous to the kingdom of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you long to know Jesus as the love of your life, this study is for you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

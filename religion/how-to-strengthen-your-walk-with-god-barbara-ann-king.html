  <title>How to Strengthen Your Walk with God - Barbara Ann King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NEW BEGINNINGS
To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. Ephesians 4:22-24
I cant say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. Love the authors commentaries on verses from the Bible and how she speaks from personal experiences. The author truly believe that God is the answer for whats missing in our lives, and when the battle to reach God gets hard, that when we pray, rejoice, and read the bible. This isnt just a book but a light that guides me out of the dark. Read, learn, and enjoy this book. I highly recommend.

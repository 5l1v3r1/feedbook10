  <title>The Quran - John W. Tharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Both the Quran and Bible purportedly hold the keys to creation, but when you examine both closely, only one of them holds up.&lt;p&gt;
A closer examination of Muhammads life and the Quran shows that both are opposed to all that God declares pure and holy. Join author John Tharp, who has traveled the world and studied these texts side by side, as he explores&lt;p&gt;
	why its no accident that the Ten Commandments were omitted from the Quran;
	which facts show Muhammads life and teachings are not pure and holy;
	how Islams teachings contribute to a world full of turmoil.&lt;p&gt;
Tharp also examines the secrets that Muslims dont share with people outside of their religion, as well as the future implications of the continuing conflict between Islam and Christianity.&lt;p&gt;
Cross the boundaries that divide Christianity, Islam and, other world religions to determine how and why they are different and why these differences are important. Youll develop a deep understanding of how satanic deception breeds hostility against those who live a godly life in &lt;i&gt;The Quran.&lt;/i&gt;" />

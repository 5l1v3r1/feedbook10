  <title>What God Has Brought Me Through - Thomas Dykes Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even though we cant control where were born or how were raised, there is nothing stopping us from achieving our goals in life. For Thomas Dykes Sr., born in South Philadelphia and raised in an African American family in the 1950s, his belief and faith in God would bring him through challenges and propel him toward a successful, fulfilling life. 
In What God Has Brought Me Through, author Thomas Dykes Sr. shares his inspirational story of faith, determination, sacrifice, and commitment. Opening with vignettes of his early years growing up in the inner city, Thomas invites us to see the way his parents instilled good family values into his and his siblings lives. This foundation would go on to help him be successful at school, paving the way for his eventual service to his country in the US Navy before going on to lead a rich and fulfilling life, both in career and in family.
Thomas never realized what he would achieve as a young man born and raised in the inner citynot to mention facing all the obstacles and challenges he would experience later in his adult life as well. But with faith and trust in God, he was able to achieve so muchand others can do the same, but only if they believe in themselves and in God." />

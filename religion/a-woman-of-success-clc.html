  <title>A Woman of Success - Clc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know Gods purpose for your life?&lt;br&gt;
Do you know how to find out what it is? In this honest, conversational account, Candace Vaught Robinson not only shares her personal story but also encourages women to be open to Gods leading as He reveals His plans for each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the worlds standards, Candace was a success, holding a good job complete with a travel expense account and a prominent view of the nations capital outside her office window. When she was laid off in 2010 after more than ten years of service that she believed represented her greatest life accomplishment, she was crushed. In retrospect, she learned a valuable life lesson: if God is preparing us for a greater purpose, we dont get to decide how or when His plans will unfold, or even the people who will be sharing them with us. More lessons followed as she became her mothers full-time caregiver and as she learns now to live without her mothers earthly presence as her ministry expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing our purpose is crucial to Gods plan, and A Woman of Success is designed to help you avoid pitfalls such as using personal insecurities to fight against loved ones instead of letting God heal relationships and discerning the difference between a call to salvation and a call to an occupation. No matter what your past has been like, its not too late to learn Gods will for you and respond with joy and confidence in knowing that He will lead the way!&lt;/p&gt;" />

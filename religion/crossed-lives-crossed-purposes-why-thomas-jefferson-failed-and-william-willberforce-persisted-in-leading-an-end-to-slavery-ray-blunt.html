  <title>Crossed Lives-Crossed Purposes: Why Thomas Jefferson Failed and William Willberforce Persisted in Leading an End to Slavery - Ray Blunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Jefferson and William Wilberforce were born at a time of great, dangerous challenges where unprecedented revolutions in thought, governments, worldview and culture swept in. Their lives, from their beginning tragedies down to their calling and early commitments to end slavery, make their stories even more amazing. Powerfully formed as leaders by exceptional mentors and lifelong supporters, they were sustained in their difficult journeys through several critical forks. While each experienced the early failure to abolish slavery, eventually one man backed away from his responsibility while the other became a globally recognized leader of mercy to the oppressed.   Why the so-called tyrant monarchy, England, was led to dissolve slavery peacefully and why the first democracy formed in liberty wasted six hundred thousand lives for the same end remains a conundrum to this day. Even more puzzling is why, despite fierce opposition, Wilberforce persisted to lead this victory while Jefferson failed to do so. This even deeper question reveals much about the power of purpose, of beliefs, worldviews, and what constitutes true success. In the end, their competing stories produce valuable lessons apt for our equally perplexing times. Whether an aspiring, young leader, one who seeks to shape the next generation, or a student of history, the reader will find here answers to important questions we all share.

  <title>It’S All About Him - Dr. Lois Brittell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its All about Him comes from an author who has wrestled with God and her own emotions. The book reveals how God has met her, leads her, and cared for her in his faithfulness. Here is a practical, helpful work for Christians who desire to grow in their life with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Kent Meads, Community Presbyterian Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement Its all about Him often leads to the question Who is he (him)? When the author asks, Who do you think he is? she gets varying responses. A few guessed it is God. When answering the question from a biblical perspective, it becomes clear God is the center of the universe: its all about Him. This awareness conflicts with many of the assumptions at work in todays culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A licensed psychologist, Dr. Brittell came across the question What is it all about? in many forms. People are searching for meaning and attachment, sometimes in all the wrong places. The loss of selfresulting from anxiety, depression, and other disordersis not only a personal loss but a cultural loss as well. For Christians there are answers in the Bible. Many have no idea how or where to find them. Those who are unfamiliar with Christian principles may have no idea where to begin looking for the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading Its All about Him you will find principles that were established at the time of creation and have continued to this day. Your sense of self, worth, and purpose are found in relationship with God. Finding God in a world full of noise, clutter, and fantasies is not always easy, but it is always simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent study for a small group setting.&lt;/p&gt;

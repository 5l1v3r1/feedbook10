  <title>Breaking the Glass Box: A Korean Woman&#39;s Experiences of Conscientization and Spiritual Formation - JungJa Joy Yu, Rosemary Radford Ruether</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Breaking the Glass Box includes spiritual formation process for liberation from gender oppression through multiple awareness practices of conflicts in han-based Korean culture of society and church. The metaphor has multiple liberation process: invisible glass box, visible glass box, breaking the glass box, and sticky rice. This liberation process includes consicentization, consciousness-raising, and a heightened cultural awareness in discerning the reasons of interpersonal conflicts in Korean socio-cultural contexts. By exploring the multi-faceted han-jeong dynamics with Feminist theology and Asian Feminism, the important aspects of re-imaging the self and God as spiritual formation have been examined with contemplative practices of Internal Family System (IFS) and self-compassion to create the healthy jeong-filled solidarity group.  The sticky rice is a new cultural paradigm for Korean women&#39;s jeong-filled hospitality. The broken pieces of the glass box will be transformed into the grains of rice by the positive jeong-filled hospitality of cooking sticky rice. In the solidarity group of jeong-filled hospitality, represented by rice ready to cook a serving of delicious sticky rice, people can enjoy the fellowship of healing, forgiving, and reconciling of the sticky rice. These images are intended to promote a healthy community of ministry and spirituality for Korean women." />

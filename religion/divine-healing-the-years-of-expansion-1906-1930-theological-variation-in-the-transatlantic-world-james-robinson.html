  <title>Divine Healing: The Years of Expansion, 1906-1930: Theological Variation in the Transatlantic World - James Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the present volume James Robinson completes his trilogy, which deals with the history of divine healing in the period 1906-1930. The first volume is a study of the years 1830-1890, and was hailed as a standard reference for years to come. The second book covers the years 1890-1906, and was acclaimed as a monumental achievement that combines careful historical scholarship and a high degree of accessibility. This volume completes the study up to the early 1930s and, like the other two works, has a transatlantic frame of reference. Though the book gives prominence to the theology and practice of divine healing in early Pentecostalism, it also discusses two other models of healing, the therapeutic and sacramental, promoted within sections of British and American Anglicanism. Some otherwise rigorous Fundamentalists were also prepared to practice divine healing. The text contributes more widely to medical and sociocultural histories, exemplified in the rise of psychotherapy and the cultural shift referred to as the Jazz Age of the 1920s. The book concludes by discussing the major role that divine healing plays in the present rapid growth of global Christianity." />

  <title>Living in Supernatural Faith - Chiadikobi Levi Emmanuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith is no longer a problem in Christ. We are recreated faith-beings. We are believers or believing ones, and not unbelievers. We have the ability to believe. This is our new nature. 
A believer is an embodiment of faith. He has the Holy Spirit as his teacheran expert teacher who came from heaven for the same purpose. He teaches the believer how to fly in the supernatural faith. Jesus said He would lead us into all truth when He comes, and glory to God, He would not hesitate in carrying out His assignment. 
However, the Holy Ghosts school is located in faiths arena, and the truth about God cannot be taught outside the faith. And so without faith, it is impossible to know Him. Therefore, by new creation the believer is adapted to approach God through faith so that with the indwelling Spirit as his teacher, none would teach his neighbor again, saying, Know God. 
The believers understanding is no longer darkened. Godwho said, Let there be lighthas commanded light to shine forth in the heart of a believer. This light is already shining in him, for God has commanded the light and will not command it again. The believer, therefore, is now a light and cannot become a light, for he is already a light. 
Any man in Christ has received a measure of faith from God (Rom 12:4). It is therefore to be disproved when Christians claim they have no faith. God dealt to everyone in Christ a measure of faith; therefore, none can claim he has none. 
We are a believing generationa generation of faith. We were adapted to do exploits in the supernatural faith. You do not need to trouble yourself on how to have faithonly understand how to fly in supernatural faith, and you will begin to do exploits." />

  <title>Ministry of Wholeness - Arlene Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The MINISTRY OF WHOLENESS
This is a true story of how God took a little girl on a painful journey to womanhood. It tells of the struggle of a young woman forced to leave school at sixteen to help support the family and after five years of this she finds herself expecting a baby, told to leave the family home and left alone to work and raise the child on her own.
It tells of a marriage to a much older man who had two heart attacks and was healed; he didnt have to have surgery. After suffering a broken marriage, two job losses and her home, she returns to her parents place for a while until she gets on her feet again. She returns to her old place of employment and finds a new place to live with her child; she also finds a new relationship with someone she thought she knew  God! It was with Jesus His Son and her life goes on a complete spin around toward Him. She speaks openly about continuing her education, entering Bible school and trusting God for the wellbeing of her child and herself, making mistakes along the way. She tells of the people who took time to educate her in the Ministry and show her that her being here on earth was not by chance; it was by Divine appointment, and that all that had happened and would happen would be handled by the Grace of God.
It tells of her marriage to an old friend that came with much heartache and pain through which God held her hand as He guided her over and around mountains of all sizes- from problem adult step-children to family and divorce- of forgiveness and remarriage and finally, wholeness in mind and spirit.
It tells of her daughter, who at 20, had married and experienced  domestic violence for eleven years that was so intense, it ended with a stabbing and her daughter being moved to a safe house; and of a mother who stepped in against the abuse that went on, but not against the family she loved. After a few days of silence she gets the call that resulted in her being landed on the doorstep of the safe house where her daughter had been taken and where God chose to show her suffering; the likes of which she had never seen in her life; the kind that caused little ones to walk around with a look of despair in their eyes and listen to an authority they did not know nor were equipped to handle; the kind that made the woman hate the man who caused this brokenness; the kind of suffering which changed her life forever. 
It tells of The Lords intervening Power in all the legal issues that followed that could have resulted in her daughter being put into prison and having her children taken away from her; of how He, The Lord, systematically orchestrated things so that she could get to where He required her to be- in His service in this area that breaks His heart every day, and His heart is in pain as He watches one family after another crumble under the various weights that have been hurled at them. She is passionate about Family and firmly believes that although there are so many fractures and breakdowns in the family structures, the One who instituted family in the first place is more than able to attend to all the problems and restore the Family to wholeness in Him- as she is proof of that.
She firmly believes that with a few institutions coming on board, husbands, wives and children can come through debilitating circumstances and be made whole. People can be in the same workforce for twenty, thirty, forty years and still work side by side in spite of differences, why cant the family? The workplace has disciplinary hearings and people take heed to warnings; why not in the family? What drives men and women to behave so disgustingly when it comes to the home? Power and control- thats what. Something about the workplace plays itself out in the home causing the unhealthiest of situations; God wants families to be well in body, mind and spirit and each member to fulfil his or her God-given role.

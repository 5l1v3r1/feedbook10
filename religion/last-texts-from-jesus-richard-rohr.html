  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Last Texts From Jesus - Richard Rohr</i></b> | “Christ is not Jesus’ last name, but we have operated as if it is and that has not helped the Christian message,” said Fr. Richard Rohr, OFM, at the 10:45 a.m. Ecumenical Service of Worship and Sermon Sunday in the Amphitheater. His sermon title was “Something Larger than Jesus,” and the Scripture text was John 1:1-18.<br /><b><i>Fr. Richard Rohr: "We Need a God ... - The Chautauquan Daily</i></b> | Jesus of Nazareth: Week 1. Who Was Jesus? Tuesday, January 16, 2018. Jesus was from the peasant class. . . . His use of language was remarkable and poetic, filled with images and stories. . . . He was not an ascetic, but world-affirming, with a zest for life. There was a sociopolitical passion to him. . . he challenged the domination system of his day. He was a religious ecstatic, a Jewish mystic, for whom God was an experiential reality. . . .<br /><b><i>Who Was Jesus? — Center for Action and Contemplation</i></b> | Richard Rohr, one of the world's most influential spiritual thinkers, delivers his long-awaited book on Jesus. In this radical message of hope, Rohr shows how "Jesus" + "Christ" reveal the divine wholeness at the heart of things and what that means for every one of us.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Last Texts From Jesus - Richard Rohr</a> </h3></p><hr/>

  <title>Booster Shots for a Healthy Soul - B. Lynn Chesnutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I sometimes gave the sermonette to a mixed audience of children from nursery school through high school at a designated time in the Sunday morning worship service at my church. I wanted the message to encourage them to develop a scholarly interest in reading and understanding the Bible. Many times I have heard adults, when questioned about what the Bible says or means about an issue, defer with comments such as Im not a Bible scholar or Ill leave that to the theologians. I wanted my own children to know that lessons taught in Sunday school and their daily living were based on Bible principles that they can comfortably and intelligently talk about with believers or nonbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

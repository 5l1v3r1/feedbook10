  <title>Miserable but Motivated - Ben Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes worship comes easy. When life seems to be sailing along smoothly without any significant troubles, it may seem natural to burst out into spontaneous praise to God. What are we to do, then, when things are not going well? Difficulties arise, plans are thwarted, and life goes into a tailspin. In the midst of all of this, we know that we are supposed to worship God. How can we do such a thing when He has allowed misery to overwhelm our lives?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is within those darkest times that we need to remember why God deserves worship. If we focus only on what He has done for us recently, it may be impossible to summon up the desire to offer Him praise. There is a secret, however, that serves as the key that will unlock the doorway of worship. That secret is found in His names.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come along on this journey with Ben as he combines a biblical study of the names of God with personal examples to help you discover how to be motivated to worship God, even when you are miserable in your circumstances.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Hammond was born and raised in southwest Michigan. He worked in the computer field for several years after earning a bachelor of science in computer information systems. In 2001 he entered the full-time pastoral ministry, serving churches in Florida and West Virginia. He is currently the pastor of First Baptist Church in Bremen, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;" />

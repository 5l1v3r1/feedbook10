  <title>Christian Mission in the Modern World - John Stott, Christopher J H Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus sends us into the world just as God the Father sent him - and yet Christians continue to disagree on what this involves. Some believe that the focus of Christian mission is evangelizing and &#39;saving souls&#39;. Others emphasize global justice issues or relief and development work. Is either view correct on its own? John Stott&#39;s classic volume, first published forty years ago, presents an enduring view of Christian mission that is just as needed today. Newly updated and expanded by Christopher J. H. Wright, Christian Mission in the Modern World provides a biblically based approach to mission that addresses both spiritual and physical needs. With his trademark clarity and conviction, Stott illuminates how the Great Commission itself not only assumes the proclamation that makes disciples, but also teaches obedience to the Great Commandment of love and service. Wright has expertly updated the original book and demonstrates the continuing relevance of Stott&#39;s prescient thinking. This balanced approach to mission encourages current and future Christians to embrace an unconflicted and holistic model of ministry." />

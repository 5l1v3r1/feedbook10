  <title>Brass Heavens: Reasons for Unanswered Prayer - Paul Tautges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it ever seem like God is not listening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes we&amp;rsquo;re tempted to wonder if God can hear us. After months or even years of praying over a particular person or situation, we look for evidence that God is getting our message or even paying attention, and we can&amp;rsquo;t find much. Why is that? Why do the heavens sometimes seem as hard and reflective as brass? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t God love us and care for us? Isn&amp;rsquo;t he all-powerful? What&amp;rsquo;s going on?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Brass Heavens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;author, pastor, and biblical counselor Paul Tautges grounds prayer in the character of our Triune God whose very nature is to share generously his good gifts with his children. Upon that foundation, Tautges then explores six reasons why at times God appears to go silent. As we examine these causes of unanswered prayer, we discover the biblical means by which we may open God&amp;rsquo;s ears to our voice once again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;God has a good and holy purpose for periods of silence. He wants to test our faith that we might see for ourselves just how weak and dependent we are on him for all good things. His goal is nothing less than to heighten our spiritual sensitivities in order to draw us into more intimate fellowship with him and more faithful obedience to him.&lt;/p&gt;" />

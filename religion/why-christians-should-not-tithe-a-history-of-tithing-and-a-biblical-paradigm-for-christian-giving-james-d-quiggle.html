  <title>Why Christians Should Not Tithe: A History of Tithing and a Biblical Paradigm for Christian Giving - James D. Quiggle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The premise of Why Christians Should Not Tithe is simple: God, having freed his people from the Law through faith in Jesus Christ, does not place on them a burden from the Law. The thesis is equally as simple: Christian giving is not a tithe. Christ challenges the believer to give himself and his possessions to the gospel cause, but the tithe fixes a limit and implies nothing more is needed. Why Christians Should Not Tithe is a thorough discussion of the four tithes in Moses&#39; Law, Jesus&#39; comments on tithing, and the twenty-one principles of giving developed by the apostles&#39; in Acts and the epistles. Included is a brief review of the history of tithing from post-apostolic times to the present. The book concludes with a new paradigm for giving not based on the tithe, but on the apostles&#39; doctrine of Christian giving. Should Christians tithe to support the gospel? Here is a study that will help every Christian discover the biblical answer for him or her self." />

  <title>Christmas of &quot;83&quot; the &quot;Birthing&quot; of a Ministry! - Rev. Dr. Lillie M. Robinson-Condeso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Book, Christmas of 1983, The &quot;Birthing&quot; Of A Ministry, A Christmas to Remember, was a very unusual Christmas to say the least, of which was unique in every way and heartbreaking at the same time.  Through major upheavals and changes in our lives and many adversities and conditions in our lives at the time were very poor.  Having to leave a house,  I owned, and the children where the children and I lived because of the violence fighting, and lack of marital harmony and  again a 3rd attempt on my life.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;A situation in which, I could not see myself in a position to even think that I could be considered to be used of God, especially with or while going through that particular situation, as such, even though, I had been ordained as a Missionary Evangelist, only a few months, prior at latter of the year before. I did not want to be ordained in the fi rst place because of the problems, I was experiencing at home and was not quite sure where it would lead or I would end up.  But evidently, the fi nal decision was not mine, but Gods.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But there is a Scripture that tells us, what the devil meant for evil, God will make it good, (paraphrased). There would be so many different direction(s) to turn. But, God himself had a plan in mind. He would work a change in our lives as we knew it, forever. And He would prove himself in the process, to be God. Hallelujah!&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Yes, God could have done things in a different manner, but He chose to manifest himself in another way. You see God has a Plan, a Purpose and a method by which to fulfill His Plan.&lt;p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="The Devil is a Father, Too, is birthed out of a series of dreams the Lord began to give me allowing me to experience the unseen world. Divinely set up visitation of the Spirit realm and the encounter of the truth, some, I refer to as a sneak preview of the supernatural realm. By which the Lord displayed the undeniable power of His word giving me a deeper understanding and knowledge of the truth that absolutely set me free and transformed my life forever. Often times, the Lord uses the mess of our life into a life time message to demonstrate and disclose His power and reach out to mankind. This revealed truth has consequently birthed a passion and pursuit of purpose that inspired me to share in this book.
The father you submit to has full power to control you. While the final choice and the decision is left up to you, but the choice and the decision you make has a very serious and eternal consequences.  Therefore, this book is inspired by the Holy Spirit to give you insight into the Truth so you make the right choice from the standpoint of understanding and knowledge of the truth." />

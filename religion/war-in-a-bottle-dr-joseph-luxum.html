  <title>War in a Bottle - Dr. Joseph Luxum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Supernatural Power of Peace&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people contain DNA. Recent studies have revealed that genes remember the past and to a certain extent can influence the present. The environment in which we live influences not only the development of our psyche but also the overall disposition in which genes play a larger role than previously thought. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 5:9, Jesus declared: Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God. Just as the Word suggests, it is not the war-makers that are blessed, but the peacemakers. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we scarcely pay attention to, as being unattractive and not dramatic enough to grab our attention, God chose to astound the world. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Corinthians 1:25 says, The foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book deals with the supernatural nature of peace, which actually heals and restores. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever before, the modern lifestyle robs us of peace; as a result, people seek an escape from stress. Some find it in chemical substances; others in time off, relaxation, or meditation. But there is a peace that surpasses human understanding. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like walking firebombs, which are bottles filled with petrol ready to go off, some people go through life without any purpose. As the title of this book suggests, the bottle must be emptied of all flammable substances; for only then one will find the much-sought-after commodity, which is the healing and restoring power of peace. &lt;p&gt;" />

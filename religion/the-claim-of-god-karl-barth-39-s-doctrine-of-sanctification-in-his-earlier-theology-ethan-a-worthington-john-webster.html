  <title>The Claim of God: Karl Barth&#39;s Doctrine of Sanctification in His Earlier Theology - Ethan A. Worthington, John Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through close readings of Karl Barth&#39;s theological work from 1916 to 1929 this book offers an exposition of Barth&#39;s doctrine of sanctification in his earlier theology--arguing that from his earliest writings after 1915 the doctrine of sanctification was one of the key theological components used in describing the encounter between God and man in a positive and concrete manner. This book both fills an important gap in Barthian scholarship and responds to the appeal by other recent interpreters of Barth&#39;s theology for a more balanced and careful exposition of his work. Throughout the course of this exposition the force of Eduard Thurnyesen&#39;s wonderfully insightful comments about Barth show themselves to be fruitfully borne out within his work from early on. That is, &quot;Karl Barth&#39;s theological thinking was from the beginning directed to the life of man . . . the life of man, on the one side, and on the other the Word of God that meets this life, lays hold of it, and transforms it.&quot;" />

  <title>Forgotten - Delphine Levesque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I believe with all my heart that I must tell my story.  From the moment that it all began on All Souls Day in November of 2008, I knew that God must have a purpose for permitting the Souls in Purgatory to visit me.&quot;  These words of the author taken from the preface of this book are  enough to capture the interest of anyone who believes in life after death.  Our thinking about the afterlife is often influenced by what comes out of the movie industry and books of fiction.  The intent is to entertain by scaring us.  The story presented here offers a different perspective.  From childhood, the author was open to the truth that Souls do seek our help to achieve  the level of purification that the Catholic faith teaches is necessary to enter Heaven.  Her journey that began with a frightening experience developed into a friendship that can inspire us to pay attention to why a place might be haunted and what we can do to assist the Souls of the Departed.  This book is an easy read and very inspirational.  It will change the way you look at life after death and at haunted places." />

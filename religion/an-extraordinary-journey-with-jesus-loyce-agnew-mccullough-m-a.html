  <title>An Extraordinary Journey with Jesus - Loyce Agnew McCullough M.A.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Biographical Sketch about the Author
Loyce Agnew McCullough was born in West Memphis, AR December 24, 1942.  Her parents were Odell and Fredericka Agnew.  She grew up in Jonesboro, AR and attended Booker T. Washington High School there.  She graduated #4 in her class.
Loyce gave her life to Christ at age 11 as her mother taught her that she must be born again.  She began to seriously study Gods Word at age 16 and discovered that the LORD would be her teacher in every subject in school.  As a result of making that discover she began making the honor roll.
Loyce went to Philander Smith College, in Little Rock, AR where she met Dorsey McCullough, a minister in training.  Loyce later went to Shorter College, North Little Rock, AR, Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, OH, and returned to Philander Smith College after getting married to Rev. Dorsey McCullough.  They both graduated together after their first three children were born: Victor, Micah and Louisa (twins).  Later, she graduated from the University of Washington with a Masters degree in education.  In the state of Washington, she had three more children: Frederick, Dorceia, and Milton.
She worked with her husband, as he served a pastor of seven churches within African Methodism.  She served as Young Peoples Director of the Kansas-Nebraska Conference Branch W.M.S, where over 70 people gave their lives to Jesus. She also became Conference Branch President for the Kansas-Nebraska Conference and the Puget Sound Conference.  She served later as the Fifth Episcopal District chairperson over the Scholarship Committee.  Many young people received scholarships for the enhancement of their education
Loyce has also taught in the following school districts in the following cities: Seattle, WA, Bremerton, WA, Wichita, KS, and in Portland, OR.  She has also tutored many children in the various churches where her husband, Rev. Dorsey McCullough was appointed pastor, especially at Brookins AME Church, Oakland, CA and Ebenezer AME Church in Stockton, CA.
Sis. Loyce worked with the Rev. Dr. Dorsey McCullough, the founder, pastor and teacher of New Directions Christian Fellowship (Interdenominational) Church, in Stockton, CA.  She has many roles as first lady: Christian Educator, Sunday School Teacher, Missionary Supervisor, writer of brochures, tracts, etc.
In September 2007, Sis. Loyce was given a dream by her heavenly father.  She dreamed that she was preaching all over this particular church.  She was so stunned that she did not even share this with her husband.  
That Friday night, they went to celebrate Pastor and Mrs. Parkers Anniversary at Wells of Living Water Community Church.  The church was filled with divine love.  Near the close of the service the Mistress of Ceremony asked her to sing a solo.   (This lady didnt even know whether or not Sis. Loyce could sing.)  The Spirit of God led her to sing He Looked Beyond My Faults and Saw My Need.  The church got on fire and would not stop singing this song. She began ministering to the people, but doesnt remember what she said.  To her, this whole experience was Gods calling her to preach and to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ. She had never experienced such anointing before.  This was indeed a wonderful, spiritual event in her life.
In November, 2008, Loyce was ordained as a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  After her husband went home to be with the Lord, (June 17, 2010)  she became the pastor of their newly founded church.
Pastor Loyce Agnew McCullough is the mother of six children; Victor Wimbley McCullough, Minister/Minister of Music;  Micah Prezel McCullough,Minister and serviceman in the Air Force, who is married to LaVonda McCullough, Louisa Michelle McCullough, a business woman,  Frederick Joseph McCullough, a pastor and evangelist in the A.M.E.Church, who is married to Courtnee Mills-McCullough, Dorceia Juanita Watkins, pastors wife, homemaker, home school teacher" />

  <title>The Little Book of Annoying Questions - Phill Bettis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States of America stands on the precipice of a New American Revolution which will either end our nation as we currently know it or propel us to new heights. Living among us is a remarkable group of revolutionaries, all Millennials, who are tasked with saving and restoring this great nation. Reminiscent of Founding Fathers George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, these God-called young men and women also share commonalities with Martin Luther and Bible heroes Moses, Gideon, David, Daniel, Esther and Nehemiah. Phill Bettis reveals how these emerging leaders will challenge and question almost everything as they begin an incredible journey toward reemergence of personal responsibility, genuine leadership and discovering God again. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unexpected leaders will face daunting challenges as many in the United States are close to giving up on our economy and political environment. Negativity abounds in the media, and instead of being united, citizens are rapidly choosing sides and asking if there is any way to turn America back to the great nation she once was. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of encouragement and unabashed reality, &lt;i&gt;The Little Book of Annoying Questions&lt;/i&gt; seeks to inject a healthy dose of optimism into our public discourse. Bettis pulls no punches, asking difficult questions that force one to confront the issues of our day. Questions posed to our institutions and to us are simultaneously uncomfortable and inspiring. Those questions reveal a remarkable path to preserve our legacy of freedom and American exceptionalism. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timely and compelling, &lt;i&gt;The Little Book of Annoying Questions&lt;/i&gt; opens the door to conversations necessary to save the heart and soul of the United States. &lt;p&gt;" />

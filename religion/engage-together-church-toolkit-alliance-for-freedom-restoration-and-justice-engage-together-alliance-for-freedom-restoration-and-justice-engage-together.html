      <meta name="description" content="The Church is uniquely positioned to end human trafficking and the exploitation of the vulnerable. Whether your church is urban, rural, large or small – the Engage Together® Church Toolkit is a powerful resource that will support your church in developing a strategic action plan for your local community and beyond. The Engage Together® Church Toolkit is designed specifically for the Church with input from experts serving in the field and churches already engaged in combating human trafficking with excellence. The information, strategies, ideas, and resources shared throughout this Toolkit are drawn from innovative and effective efforts taking place all across our nation today. *Be sure to get the Engage Together® Church Teaching Series, which brings the Church Toolkit to life through media, discussion guides, community assessment tools, and more. The Church Toolkit (9781532307867) is a spiral bound workbook. The toolkits are similar but the Church version is designed for a church or religious based institution. The Community version would be used by a civic organization (e. g. Kiwanis, Rotary Club, etc.) or municipal government." />

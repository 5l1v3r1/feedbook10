  <title>Blood Money - Arome E. Tokula</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians are living in lack and not enough because they havent been properly taught the power of the sacrifice of Jesus as it concerns their wealthy inheritance in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLOOD MONEY; Understanding Covenant Wealth is a revelation and divine understanding of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, the power that is available to us today and how every believer can take advantage of that sacrifice in establishing Gods covenant of wealth here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Arome E. Tokula teaches that there are three primary areas of the believers redemption; redemption from sin, redemption from sickness and redemption from poverty. Many have enjoyed salvation and experienced deliverance from sin, addictions, sicknesses and pains but are yet to even know that the same sacrifice has provided them freedom from financial bondage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raises a clarion call for believers to know how much MONEY and WEALTH are an intrinsic part of the finished works of Christ Jesus and how a consciousness of our BLOOD COVENANT with God through Jesus and the blessing upon the believer whose heart is circumcised can help them live in abundance even in this worlds system.
He literally sets you on an inciting journey through the pages of this book to learn in simple terms profound truths. Some of the chapters include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Glory and The Blood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Kinds of Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ultimate Sacrifice for Wealth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blessing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover and The Takeover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money in the Redemption&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="In the life of &quot;Spiritual Pilgrim&quot; what strikes one particularly is how each manifestation of God is so marvelous that it throws in the shade or blots out entirely all those that preceded it.

It is as though God presented one aspect of His Divine Goodness to them and then withdrew it, saying, &quot;Not this, it is not this&quot;, and then another aspect, and withdrew it also, saying again, &quot;No, not this, it is not this.&quot;  We have grown indeed, but in worldly wisdom, and the unquestioning and undivided love we vowed to God when we were little has been scattered to the winds. We found it would cost us a great effort, and a life-long one, to love God as we should, to keep on loving Him, thus, we compromised the matter. In reality, what takes place is this: God is working that precious material, the mystic soul, He is pressing from inside, extending its boundaries of mystical knowledge." />

    	<p>In the life of "Spiritual Pilgrim" what strikes one particularly is how each manifestation of God is so marvelous that it throws in the shade or blots out entirely all those that preceded it. They are at a loss to express their admiration of this effect of God's love. Something similar to this takes place in the mystic soul. It is as though God presented one aspect of His Divine Goodness to them and then withdrew it, saying, "Not this, it is not this", and then another aspect, and withdrew it also, saying again, "No, not this, it is not this." We have grown indeed, but in worldly wisdom, and the unquestioning and undivided love we vowed to God when we were little has been scattered to the winds. We found it would cost us a great effort, and a life-long one, to love God as we should, to keep on loving Him, thus, we compromised the matter. In reality, what takes place is this: God is working that precious material, the mystic soul, He is pressing from inside, extending its boundaries of mystical knowledge.</p>

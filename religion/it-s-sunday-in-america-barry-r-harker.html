  <title>It’S Sunday in America - Barry R. Harker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its Sunday in America is about the return of mandatory Sunday worship and rest to the center of American national life and how this will shape the future of America and the world. 
American greatness rests upon its constitutional guarantees of civil and religious liberty. Separation of church and state in America created favorable conditions for human flourishing. Despite this, American history records numerous attempts at the state level to undermine the principle of separation through the establishment of laws regulating Sunday. For half a century after 1888 persistent attempts to introduce national Sunday legislation were made.
Today, proponents of the myth of separation suggest the founding fathers never intended a wall of separation between church and state. Two competing conceptions of American freedom and greatness are contending for the loyalty of Americans. The rise of the religious right is creating the space in which conceptions of freedom and greatness that ruled seventeenth-century New England are seeping back into national consciousness. Sunday observance is central to these conceptions.
Its Sunday in America is a timely warning about the emerging threats to religious liberty in the worlds greatest democracy." />

  <title>A Contemporary, Rational Examination of the Sciences of the Holy Qur’An - Allama Dr. Sani Salih Mustapha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quran is that Single Heavenly Message that underwent so many passages through the evolution of mankind under the Guidance of Allah, the Lord of the universe to appear as the chosen, simplified and perfected code of conduct in the hands of Muhammad Rasulullah. Examining its Sciences convinces one of its Miraculous Nature, its conformity and confirmation of the Torah. It explains avidly that man has the faculty of discrimination, as a result of his ability to develop, grow, progress and to direct independently his own way of living. The base of this is in the Knowledge the Lord of the universe taught him. Harmony and Peace are comprehensive terms enveloping all that man needs for his survival in this world. The objective of examining the Sciences of the holy Quran is to find a safe passage and a way of living, in perfect harmony and peace, between mankind, his environment and his Creator. Secondly it enables one to understand and realize what will happen to one if he dies. Those reading the Scriptures have come across the Promise of Allah for reward and punishment in this earthly world and in the Hereafter. The holy Quran, the last of such Scriptures teaches the same. Allah summed up this in the holy Quran 53:38-41, That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another. And that man can have nothing but what he does (good or bad). And that his deeds will be seen. The he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.&lt;br&gt;" />

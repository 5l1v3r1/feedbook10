  <title>The Magnificent Experiment - Christian M. Wiese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine waking up one day and experience a forcethe Taoopening up to you? You may have been intrigued by Eckhart Tolles &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt; or admired Neale Walschs ability to have conversations with God. Along the Tao, you will be able to experience both by allowing yourself to be synchronized with the flow of the universe. You will learn that every meeting with someone is a holy encounter and that all problems and opportunities that come your way are presents hand-delivered by the Tao just for you. There is no faith required to connect with the Tao; just be willing to experience life with a new perspective. Expect many changes in your life with the Tao as your coach, specifically:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let your subconscious agenda and internal conflicts be revealed to you
Channel your energies in a new, purposeful direction
Learn to be guided by synchronicity
Be the Law of Attraction
Discover the Christian power of positive thinking
Flourish in the every professional setting by embracing the power of the 4 Cs:&lt;br&gt; 
   creativity, communication, connectivity, and caring
Realize the love, peace, and security of the Psalm 23 traveler yourself
Experience life as a fairy tale
Start your journey toward wholeness
Live your life as a magnificent experiment&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola - St. Ignatius of Loyola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius&quot; is a collection of Christian meditations intended to guide one on a 28-30 day process of spiritual purification and connection with Jesus. This text, written by the great St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) has been extensively practiced and studied for hundreds of years. It has become a major text of the Christian canon and is a fundamental text of Ignatian and Jesuit spirituality. This volume presents the complete and original set of Ignatian prayers and meditations, organized into five parts: Creation, Mankind, The Kingdom of God, Christ, and the Trinity. Intended to be carried out over four weeks in retreat, these exercises are full of theological insight, Christian revelation, and contemplative guidance that, together, offers a path toward personal solace. &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; is a methodical approach to Jesuit spirituality, though it is accessible to a wide audience of lay people and curious readers alike. Beautifully composed, the work is a moving account of the nature of the soul and human spirituality. This timeless work of Christian Mysticism continues to resonant around the world, offering a path of spiritual meditation and awakening." />

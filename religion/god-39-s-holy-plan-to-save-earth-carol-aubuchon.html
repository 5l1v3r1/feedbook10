  <title>God&#39;s Holy Plan to Save Earth - Carol Aubuchon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;The following message was written for you by God&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is God, Creator of all Heaven and Earth. I give this message for you as well as all thus written of Our novel in place. 
&lt;p&gt;I first wish to tell My children that this book is not part of fictional mind. The lessons within this novel are true presents of faith given of you through My child of earth to present My thoughts of this Holy Plan. Should you be remiss and think otherwise, I will bring suffering of mind around earth through her travel of your countries to impress upon your minds how real this message will be taken by My children. No one will know when I choose this form of event to broadcast My will of your thoughts given Me. But many will fear Our course of action taken when this begins. 
&lt;p&gt;Now I say, those of you who know Me, will give Me heed of their time and give My daughter just love of her as she brings Our word and direction to you. 
&lt;p&gt;God has chosen to give earth a chance to change what is written in the Bible about the end of the world. This Plan is Gods Holy way of letting everyone on earth know that through Him all eternity can change. God has no choice but to give love freely to all who He created. This is how Our Heavenly Father has graced us since the beginning of time. Openly and without grudge of those who have moved against His will for their lives. 
&lt;p&gt;Welcome God into your life for a few hours while you read His Holy terms and conditions regarding this Plan. Be as open minded as you think someone else should be to your ideas, and allow Our Master Being to invite you into His mind for a change. See what God thinks about all the changes mankind has made to confront Satan on his own and how much stronger Our fight against evil would be if we only let Our Father help us. 
&lt;p&gt;All earth is in turmoil presently, and many people have given God prayers to ask for His help. 
We have never learned the correct manner to pray of Our Heavenly Father, who justifies our selfish prayer by allowing some correction made us. However, now God wants us to learn the correct terms of Holy Prayer to His being. We need not spend hours in prayer to get what we need to sustain life here on earth. But we need correct manner and guidance from God to know how to live each day according to His plan of our life. 
&lt;p&gt;Never before in the history of earth, has Our LORD come to us to ask us to give His Soul Peace. But today with the publishing of this Novel of Main Events, God is changing the way He treats mankind for all time. We have never been asked by Our Creator to give Him this much attention before. God is now within moments of ending earth of Evil due to Satan and his fellow angels, who are tormenting human beings to show their revenge on God for sending them from Heaven. 
&lt;p&gt;Our Father in Heaven is now creating a new world for us, where love is prevalent above all else done. We need to come to God, our life planner, for details of the way we need to conduct ourselves daily. Should this plan fail and we not live up to the course His plan draws out for us, within the next few short years, destruction of earth will begin. 
&lt;p&gt;God is asking all mankind to adhere to this plan, regardless of your religion, background, country laws, or efforts forced against you. This is how earth will replace pain in His soul with the love His time spent with us has greatly deserved. Mankind has not given their Heavenly Father love completely as was His will when creating us. God created man to show Him honor and give love back to His being. Every time man touches against the will of Satan, in the presence of The Father, it brings excruciating pain of remorse to His being. 
&lt;p&gt;Time now has changed, for God is no longer able to withstand our pained attempts of His form. 
He sees us fall into traps set by Satan, with no knowledge of this invisible beast of prey. Now God is on the at" />

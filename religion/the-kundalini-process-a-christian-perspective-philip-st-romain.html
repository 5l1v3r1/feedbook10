  <title>The Kundalini Process: A Christian Perspective - Philip St. Romain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, author and spiritual director, Philip St. Romain, presents an understanding of the kundalini process that can help Christians recognize its signs and its place in the spiritual life. Following up on his earlier work, &quot;Kundalini Energy and Christian Spirituality: A Pathway to Growth and Healing,&quot; Philip uses the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas and more modern approaches to human nature to explain how kundalini is a natural process that is designed to integrate all of the levels of our human nature in deep union with God. He notes that this process is at work in all of us at a very low and gentle level, but that it can become intensified in certain conditions, presenting major challenges and blessings for those who experience such activations.   This book is sure to help pastors, spiritual directors, and anyone interested in spiritual growth come to a better understanding of the mysterious transformative power that lies deep within all of us." />

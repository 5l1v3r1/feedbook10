  <title>Mercy Reigns in the Journey of Faith - Dani Mkhwananzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christianity is a journey; it is a journey most of us start when God finds us in our sinfulness and delivers us to our righteousness for his names sake (Psalm 23:3). It is a process that we have to be aware of, and we have to be aware of our responsibility at each stage in order to progress to the next stage of our journey. The scriptures tell us of the journey the children of Israel had from their place of slavery, Egypt, where God rescued them with his powerful arm and then journeyed with them in the wilderness to bring them to their Promised Land, Canaan, a land he had promised to their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
This journey that the Israelites had is quite similar to the journey that we Christians have; the only difference is that they did their journey physically and God was with them physically as well, while ours is a spiritual journey and he is in us as the Holy Spirit, guiding us. The canon has recorded their journeys story for us to learn from and do ours better (1 Corinthians 10:6). Ive noted through the scriptures that it was just through Gods mercy that they made it through to the Promised Land; even though most of them died in the wilderness, those who made it did so only because he was merciful to them. Ive realised that I have also survived thus far just by his grace. This is what this book is all abouthis mercy that has covered me thus far, the same mercy that carried the children of Israel on their journey from Egypt to Canaan." />

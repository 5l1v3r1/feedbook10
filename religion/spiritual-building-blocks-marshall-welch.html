  <title>Spiritual Building Blocks - Marshall Welch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spiritual Building Blocks takes the greatest commandment and uses it as the cornerstone in building a spiritual foundation to help notice Gods presence in our everyday lives. Part 1 begins by unpacking the greatest commandment into six essential parts: God, the self, our neighbor, our head, our heart, and our hands. The opening chapters answer common questions about spirituality and its relationship with religion. Part 2 presents a variety of spiritual practices and exercises using our head, heart, and hands as building blocks to nurture our spiritual lives as we love God, the self, and our neighbors. Some of these practices may be new while others may be familiar but reframed in a new way. Personal stories by everyday people illustrate many of these exercises. Spiritual Building Blocks was written for individuals or small groups interested in deepening their spiritual lives." />

  <title>The Triune Story - Robert W. Jenson, Brad East, Bruce D. Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the time of his death in the autumn of 2017, Robert W. Jenson was arguably America&#39;s foremost theologian. Over the course of a career spanning more than five decades, much of Jenson&#39;s thought was dedicated to the theological description of how Scripture should be read-what has come to be called theological interpretation. In this rapidly expanding field of scholarship, Jenson has had an inordinate impact.
Despite its importance, study of Jenson&#39;s theology of scriptural interpretation has lagged, due in large part to the longevity of his career and volume of his output. In this book, all of Jenson&#39;s writings on Scripture and its interpretation have been collected for the first time. Here readers will be able to see the evolution of Jenson&#39;s thought on this topic, as well as the scope and intensity of his late-period engagement with it. Where other twentieth-century thinkers rely on non-theological, secular methods of scriptural investigation, Jenson is willing to let go of &quot;respectability&quot; for the sake of a truly Christian theological interpretation. The result is a genuinely free, intellectually invigorating exercise in reading and theory from one of the greatest theologians in the last century." />

  <title>Tuesday&#39;s Girl - Lisa Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Then one day a thought entered my mind. How do you know youre saved? When did you ever say The Sinners Prayer? I tried to tell myself these thoughts were nonsense and that I had nothing to worry about.&lt;br&gt;
Those fears continued to grow. I wasnt able to control my thoughts. Each time I made a mistake I would wonder:&lt;br&gt;
 Do I need to say The Sinners Prayer?&lt;br&gt;
 Do I need to be baptized again?&lt;br&gt;
 Why did I think that? I know that is wrong.&lt;br&gt;
 Am I possessed? How could that be?&lt;br&gt;
Very few people knew I was struggling with this. Those who did know were loving, supportive, and prayerful. Yet nothing they did helped me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. Micah 7:8" />

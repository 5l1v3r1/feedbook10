  <title>In Defense of Jesus - Joseph Ellis Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book I hope will take away your fears about death. There is an afterlife. This book will take you there if you let it. Your life is in your hands, but you have to be led. Read and find out how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look and listen and observe. Look at your reason for what you do and the outcome. Listen to your inner thoughts, your subconscious. Observe your surroundings for any pitfalls. You must believe and know there are spirits at work in your life, good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound crazy, but there are wicked spirits that have a wicked sense of humor. For instance, if you have a dog or dogs, you might go to the pet store and buy them clothes. Animals were not created to wear clothes. The people who sell these clothes are being used without knowing it by these evil spirits, to harm these animals, which are part of God creation. The harm is, putting clothes on dogs takes away their natural means of protection from the weather. These spirits get a kick out of watching us do stupid things. The purpose of this book is to show you how to get the good spirits to protect you from the bad ones. First you have to admit they are real and learn how to do what it takes to get the good spirits to help you.&lt;/p&gt;" />

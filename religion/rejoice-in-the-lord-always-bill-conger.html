  <title>Rejoice in the Lord Always - Bill Conger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seven-year-old Jeff Hillman loved to skateboard, make mischief, and fish. But everything changed the day he contracted a mysterious illness called Reyes syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this insightful glimpse into the life of a young man who died and then returned to tell about itwho encountered angels and experienced dramatic healingyou can see that God is still a God of miracles. He not only sees us in our struggles; He meets us in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness the power of faith as Jeff and his family choose to focus not on the hardship of the moment but on Gods ability to love them through it. Rejoice in the Lord with them as they learn that joy and peace come with believing that God is using all of lifes twists and turns to accomplish purposes far beyond our understanding. Jesus Christ can provide just what we need to live not as victims, but as victors. But will we, like Jeff Hillman, choose to trust in Him?&lt;/p&gt;" />

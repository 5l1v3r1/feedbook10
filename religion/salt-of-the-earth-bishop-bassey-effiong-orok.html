  <title>Salt of the Earth - Bishop Bassey Effiong Orok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written by a born Prophet and reputable Spiritual Scientist, His Lordship Bishop Bassey Effiong Orok; Salt of the Earth is a package of universal realities, and an eye-opener to all of humanity, as it unveils the universal components that are within the occupant of the prestigious Office of Christhood called Christ, as it combines mysteries of eternal science and pure spirituality to prove its facts. 
It likens Christ to what is generally called Salt, which naturally transforms into a crystalline substance, gives seawater its characteristic taste and is used for seasoning or preserving food. This book reveals Christ as the natural origin of salt, making a critical discussion about salt as the seasoning instrument of life, and following up by explaining the spiritual, physical and potential meaning of salt. It also unveils the circumstances behind the first usage of salt, which hitherto was hidden from man. Among other contents are Christ as the Heavenly Taste and Controller of Salt; the existence of salt in the seven continents of the world and the different powers attached to salty and fresh water. It provides details on top issues such as the thirty-four blessings of the elects of Christ, the seven messengers of His elects, the twenty-six will-powers, and eight merriment awaiting His elects. Before revealing the salvation that awaits the elects of Christ, it examines in-depth the meaning of the phrase, Salt of the Earth, as well as the ten different natural expressions of the salty manifestation of the saints, the Elects of Christ, His power of preservation and His unlimited power of manifestation, the quality of salvation, and the fourteen reasons why Christ receives the highest award and honour in the entire Universe. It is a book that cuts across all boundaries, irrespective of religion, faith, belief, nations, tribes and tongues.

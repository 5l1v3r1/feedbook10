  <title>From Eulogy to Joy - Kristina Chase Strom, Cynthia Kuhn Beischel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;From Eulogy To Joy is a unique, autobiographical anthology. These moving and thought-provoking personal stories are shared from the heart and contain the words of people who are experts by virtue of having experienced grief firsthand in myriad situations: loss of children, siblings, parents, mates, relatives and friends through accidents, illness, suicide, murder and natural death. From Eulogy to Joy provides comfort and reassurance that grief is intensely individual and, as such, all responses are appropriate. This book unveils the revolutionary fact that, contrary to common belief, we never get over the death of someone close and actually never should. Rather, death is a life-transforming experience to get through and eventually grow through to a place of inner peace and renewed joy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is only one name on the death certificate. Read From Eulogy To Joy and learn that life is full of commencements, not terminations.&lt;P&gt;Bernie Siegel, MD, author of Love, Medicine and Miracles&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;beautiful book...on a very important topic...approached in a very heartfelt way...&lt;P&gt;Dr.Richard Carlson, author of Dont Sweat the Small Stuff&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From Eulogy To Joy is a wonder...so important and helpful. Theres nothing like it out there. Im proud to be included. May this book help millions.&lt;P&gt;Dr. Christiane Northrup, author of Womens Bodies, Womens Wisdom&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I was deeply moved by the voices from the heart in From Eulogy To Joy. It will inspire us all as we feel we are alone in facing death. The words are clear and real.&lt;P&gt;Dr. Jenny Yates, author of Jung on Death and Immortality&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The pieces in From Eulogy To Joy are written by people from all walks of life, from the mundane to the magnificent. Among them are: Neale Donald Walsh, the New York Times best selling author of Conversations with God, Books I, II and III; Judy Belushi, who wrote Samurai Widow after the death of her husband John; and Dr. Rabbi Earl Grollman, author of Living When A Loved One Has Died and Living with Loss: Healing with Hope--A Jewish Perspective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;www.celestialperspectives.com/fromeulogytojoy&lt;/P&gt;" />

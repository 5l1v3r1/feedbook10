  <title>Turkey Character - Marthus-Adden Zimboiant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I never thought turkey could be studied to relate to everyday life. I know some behaviours of turkey, especially the way he drags his wing-tips on the ground and the way he walks. However, I didnt know that all such behaviours have something to do with everyday life.
     In fact, how Sir Marthus has studied these behaviours of turkey is so stirring. I never knew turkey is that arrogant! In reality, studying turkey is shunning arrogance. Indeed turkey is a bad leader!
     I have read Turkey Character and I must admit that I was moved by the words of wisdom Sir Marthus used for this book. It has made me realize all the sins I had committed, and truly I have regretted them. I find this book very interesting, informative, and life changing. Turkey Character gives me inner peace and wisdom. It has changed my way of life. It has made me a better person. Although we are just humans, and so we tend to commit mistakes, Turkey Character has taught me to think first before doing anything that makes me regret it for the rest of my life. Read Turkey Character and your life will never be the same." />

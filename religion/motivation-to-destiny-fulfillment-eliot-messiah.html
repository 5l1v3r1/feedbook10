  <title>Motivation to Destiny Fulfillment - Eliot Messiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Motivation to Destiny Fulfillment: The Realities of Life is the extended and comprehensive version of the e-book Motivation to Destiny Fulfillment. If someone tells you in any way that reality is not real, regardless of the persons background or status, that person is not telling you the truth and must not be trusted in any way for any reason. Many have faced the realities of life on the way of fulfilling their destinies and could not withstand it, hence their inability to fulfill their destinies. There are others who also faced the reality of storms on the way of realizing the fulfillment of their dreams and were able to confront it, thereby fulfilling their destinies with testimonies. These people are those who recognize reality yet refuse to keep their eyes on it but rather look at Jesus Christ and focus on him for leadership. You are born not to live with realities of life that can keep you far away from destiny fulfillment; instead, deal with the realities in order to fulfill your destiny. The realities of life are real. However, if you are determined and focused on your dreams, visions, and destiny by taking away your eyes from the storms of life and beholding the face of Jesus Christ with believe and faith, you would surely make it to glory. I urge you to remain resolute to your dreams. This book is to help you identify and appreciate your destiny and how you can fulfill it to the glory of God. God bless you as you read. Thank you." />

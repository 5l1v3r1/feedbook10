  <title>Life After Heaven - Rev. Robert Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the missing gospel, that portion of the gospel the church has lost sight of; the biblical gospel currently not being taught or preached. Its about hope found in Scripture but missing today. Heavens purpose, the joys we will know there, and the glorious future arriving soon. Salvations final chapter, written by God and disclosed in Scripture. Its about the uniqueness of Jesus, what hes done for us, and what he will ultimately do for God. The joy that was set before him that enabled him to endure the cross, and hells possibilities now that the gates of hell cannot prevail against us.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its about Gods purpose in making us one with Jesus and the power of prayer to make us fellow heirs with him of all things. Its about life when Gods will is done on earth as it is in heaven, our service in the coming kingdom and those we will serve. Discovering this missing hope alerts us to the dangers in the counterfeit gospels popular today. You will see that even if we were to gain the whole world, it would not compare to life after heaven.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you for the opportunity to edit &quot;Life After Heaven.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, insightful, and unflinching, your impressiveanalysis of Scripture and your keen understanding of faith,especially in light of the gospel and prayers from the NewTestament, will undoubtedly touch the hearts and stir theminds of countless believers for years to come.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

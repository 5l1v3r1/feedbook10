  <title>Rediscovering the Church Fathers - Michael A. G. Haykin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While the church today looks quite different than it did two thousand years ago, Christians share the same faith with the church fathers. Although separated by time and culture, we have much to learn from their lives and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is an organized and convenient introduction to how to read the church fathers from AD 100 to 500. Michael Haykin surveys the lives and teachings of seven of the Fathers, looking at their role in such issues as baptism, martyrdom, and the relationship between church and state. Ignatius, Cyprian, Basil of Caesarea, and Ambrose and others were foundational in the growth and purity of early Christianity, and their impact continues to shape the church today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evangelical readers interested in the historical roots of Christianity will find this to be a helpful introductory volume.&lt;/p&gt;" />

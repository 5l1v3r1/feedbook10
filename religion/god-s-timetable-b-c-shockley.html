      <meta name="description" content="The First Earth Age
* The timeline is called the great gap theory of what happened before the six-day creation and Genesis 1:2.
* A timeline chart is provided from the beginning of creation until the end of time and beyondAlpha and Omega.
* This book covers the subjects below:
When was the earth created?
What happened to the prehistoric habitations in the first earth age?
What happened to the prehistoric animals?
Where did the demons come from, because they were not made that way?
When did the continents of land shift? And how?
How did the Ice Age come about?
How did the earth become without form and void? Darkness covered the deep, and the earth was covered with water.
All of the above happened before the six-day creation!
All the above are backed up with scriptures.
The rest of the book takes you clearly into the end of time and what happens beyondinto eternity." />

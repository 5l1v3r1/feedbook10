  <title>Through Stained Glass - Marlene Louise Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teaching medical ethics to interns at the medical center of Wilmington, Delaware; students at the Eastern University in Saint Davids, Pennsylvania; students at the Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland; and students at the Nursing School of Wilmington gave her a unique ability to question and debate issues, such as abortion, euthanasia, suicide, living wills, hospice, and physician-assisted suicide. These dilemmas are also presented in this book.
The Holy Bible is frequently referenced, as well as personal observations of courage, gratitude, forgiveness, faith, anger, prayer, and Gods love in the midst of pain and suffering. Everyone has many ups and downs in their lives as some obstacles and difficulties are overwhelming. What can I do to help overcome these stumbling blocks?
Through Stained Glass attempts to offer positive guidance to those whove survived losses and need a hopeful outlook through their life changes. This book will reflect the love of God to every person, regardless of their handicap, ethnicity, gender, or religion." />

  <title>From Glory to Glory - Michael R. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is our desire, that in these last days, that the Body of Christ reach its full potential as a beautifully, adorned bride, without spot or blemish, bringing all glory and honor to Jesus Christ. It is the Holy Spirit who teaches, coaches, and guides us into Godly wisdom. We can either live our lives through our own understanding, or we can live the life that God has designed for us. Who is the potter, and who, or what, is the clay? God wants to fashion and form us into the vessel that He wants us to be. That only happens in our lives through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;p&gt;
Second Corinthians 3:16-18 (The Amplified Bible)&lt;p&gt;
But whevever a person turns (in repentence) to the Lord, the veil is stripped off and taken away. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation from bondage, freedom). And all of us, as with unveiled faces (because we continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the very glory of the Lord), we all refect that glory and are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever-increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another: [for this all comes to us] from the Lord [Who is] the Spirit." />

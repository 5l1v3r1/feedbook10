  <title>Tibet - F. Genard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tibet is a place of mystic Buddhism, conserved into its own cult, with its generic Bodpa inhabitants in one unity of manners and language. Tibet occupies the most enormous and highest mass of mountains, and broadly divided into two regions - is full of lakes and rivers. The graceful river of Brahmaputra receives the life-blood here in the glan of sporting fountains to serpent the longest earth up through the Indian inviting plains. Graceful Tibet resides on the roof of the world with her inhabitants, cultured to bespeak of innocent godliness and the diseaseless beauty. More often, it seems a land, high on the world, of angels and angel-ladies. Dilapidated, though, in recent years, by the insincere and non-authoritative aggression of feded red China the mountainous living of the people has increased in adverse conditions, the richness of religion and customs has braved them, the angels, to assert their non-violent and peaceful proclaims more distinctively for non-controversial democratic liberty, under the policy and administration head, clergy Dalai Lama. No doubt, today this peace-land though controversial, has made a strong stir of curiosity about her across the world. This condition has brought a two-fold boon to the land: the majority between the Poles stands curious about these non-violent people seeking their autonomy suddenly increasing the turns of Tourism, and secondly, embrace her cause more opinion fully and determinatively. The comprehensive work, of art and study, into two parts, opens upon this pious land, and the contours and recesses of nature and angelic world of this land, in all dimensions, are vivid in the light of search and study. The first part like a tale of unknowingness starts to amaze the readers with vivid accounts. In this part, the author makes a journey through the in-parts of the land meeting with and providing the inmost accounts that is possible only if one interacts with people to people, place to place and finally as a whole of Tibet. The second part introduces Tibet as a nation with its own people and culture, and other tangible systems and affairs needful for a successful run of a state, viz. economy, administration, politics etc. The readers from all parts of the world will find it a good resource on Tibet, the homeland of peaceful Buddhist people." />

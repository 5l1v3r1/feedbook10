  <title>Strength - Dr. M.P. Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This will not be like any other Devotional you have read, for this is not a book that you read in your intellect. It is a Chapter in the book of Life  YOUR LIFE. God is summoning you to a higher place of understanding. We have the blessing of the Word of God that was written by men who were under the Anointing. They did not know at the time of their writing that they were writing what would become known as the Holy Bible. The Apostle Paul simply wrote love letters to those of whom God assigned him to minister to. He did not know that his letters would be baptized with the fire of God and save thousands of generations. His life, all the triumphs as well as the failures of his life became an open book, and so is yours. Kings, Shepherds, Judges, Warriors, even Gods enemy has a page in the book of life. Your story is life as well and it is being written by the angels. In reality the Book of Life has three parts, and they are The Old Testament, The New Testament and the Book that Jesus spoke of in heaven called the Lambs Book. This Book, The Lambs Book is the Third Book, and you are among the number characters in that book. Mal 3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. Live Holy because the Angels are keeping notes. They are writing your every experience, your every failure, triumph, your every praise is being written at this very moment and one day your name will be called and the book will be opened and you will have to give an account for the things you have done. This devotional will be included in the Third Part. Read and Grow thereby. God is watching and the Angels are writing as the Saga of Holiness Continues." />

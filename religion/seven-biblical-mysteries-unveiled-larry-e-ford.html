  <title>Seven Biblical Mysteries Unveiled! - Larry E. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the development of Christian theology through the centuries, it has been generally believed that the theology of the Bible has been settled. That would be possible if there was only one true church and everyone in it believed and practiced Pauls description in Ephesians 4:316in effect, the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God. However, over thirty-two thousand opposing, contradictory Christian denominations misrepresent the unity that God desires for those who should worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:2324). The objective in presenting the seven biblical mysteries is to focus the readers attention on the difference between what appears to be settled theology and what Gods Word actually teaches us. The difference between the two should encourage the reader to rethink traditional views and to study the Bible in more depth with the hope and expectation that God will reveal the meanings of His mysteries in his or her faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />

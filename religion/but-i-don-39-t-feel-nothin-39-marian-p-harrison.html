  <title>But I Don&#39;t Feel Nothin&#39; - Marian P. Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian life is what I believe to be a continuous journey, growing spiritually toward perfection; however, maturity only comes from a clear understanding of being truthful of the real person you are. Christians often display sheer hypocrisy, wearing masks to impress others, so the real person never matures. We rely on the opinions of the experts and usually feel that their opinions are the only ones that matter.
I feel were living at a time when many people are hurting inside and have to deal with many unpleasant obstacles while wholeheartedly trying to be that perfect person. I pray that this book will appeal to baby Christians, whether nineteen or ninety. Being a competent toastmaster, Ive spoken in many programs about the hardships of life, and some people have asked me how Ive been able to relate to many issues and speak with such passion. I explained that these issues were my own personal experiences that God has allowed me to learn from and endure. Consequently, after hearing some of my speeches, which were limited, some people have told me that I should write a book, so thats why I decided to put my thoughts in writing.
But I Dont Feel Nothin relates to a few of the various feelings we experience in life, which we must deal with, and it reminds us that life is not always about feeling good. Ive also met many unchurched people who experienced hurtful feelings from church leaders who never explained the Christian life at a level they could comprehend. As a result of unhealthy ways to mask the pain, I believe, many suicides are the result of people feeling empty, useless, no good, unloved, etc. They cant get past the circumstances surrounding cancer, divorce, joblessness, repossession, foreclosure, loneliness, etc., to push past the pain and live more productive lives.
My primary goal is that someone will read this book and understand how to accomplish their specific assignments in life. Moreover, I believe that this book will at least raise an awareness from a laymans perspective to open more dialogue and discussions relating to our feelings. Most people make unsuccessful efforts to please so many other people rather than try to please God and themselves.
Even though professional help is more available today, God is usually left out of the therapy or maybe only casually mentioned, so this can result in dealing with habits that are not easily broken, as some analysts feel they should be. But the analysts themselves usually have never experienced what the patient is dealing with. This book is not to discredit the expertise of our extensively trained psychoanalysts, who I believe have been beneficial to many individuals. Even though Im considering researching actual statistical data to validate some of my suggestions, I feel it would take away from the appeal to the baby Christians and move the book into an arena for more mature Christians to dissect. I believe that this would create more problems and become less attractive. I speak as a layman, with real issues and problems, who only desires to share my nameless relationships to help someone else. Specific names and churches are not mentioned in the book, only my personal issues; and having lived in five different states, attending various churches, I made sure no one will be aware of who my references are." />

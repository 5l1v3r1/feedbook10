  <title>Walking Each Other Home: Reflections about Living a Christian Life from an Older Dad to His Daughter - Peter C. Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The English writer G. K. Chesterton once wrote: &quot;Nothing taken for granted; everything received with gratitude; everything passed on with grace.&quot; These reflections are the author&#39;s effort, as an older father, to pass on to his daughter, with grace, what he believes is truly important in life.  When his daughter was young, he used to tell her that his constant prayer was to live long enough so that &quot;I can get you raised!&quot; Thankfully, that prayer has been answered. But parenting is a life-long process that evolves as we and our children grow older. Through the years, Dr. Wilcox has discovered that being an older father has advantages and disadvantages. If age gives one more life experience and wisdom, then hopefully these reflections will be a way that he can share his life and wisdom with her and others.  Throughout thirty years as a psychotherapist and spiritual director, Dr. Wilcox counseled many fathers who were genuinely trying to be good parents. This book is intended to help fathers influence, in a positive way, the life choices their daughters will make. It is an invitation to explore how we can continue to help our daughters grow spiritually and psychologically into the person God is calling them to become." />

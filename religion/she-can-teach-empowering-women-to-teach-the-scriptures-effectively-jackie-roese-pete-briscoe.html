  <title>She Can Teach: Empowering Women to Teach the Scriptures Effectively - Jackie Roese, Pete Briscoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conservative evangelical women are least likely to be trained in the areas of teaching and preaching. It&#39;s a tragic state of affairs, given the central value that our tradition places on the Scriptures. In this book, Jackie Roese examines the forces, both past and present, that have discouraged women from becoming trained. We&#39;ll discover that women are indeed called, gifted, and mandated in Scripture to herald the Word of God. The first half of the book will focus on encouraging women to become as fully equipped as our male counterparts, and to use their uniquely female voice in proclaiming truth to other women in various settings outside pulpit preaching. But encouragement isn&#39;t enough. Many women who already teach Bible studies, or who desire to teach, are in no position to pursue formal studies in a seminary. To that end, the second half of She Can Teach is dedicated to developing homiletic skills. Together we will learn how to study a passage, find the main idea, and build and deliver a biblical message. By the end of this book, the reader will be better equipped to proclaim truth, through her uniquely female voice, to her female audience." />

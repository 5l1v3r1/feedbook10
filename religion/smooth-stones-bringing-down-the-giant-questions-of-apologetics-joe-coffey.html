  <title>Smooth Stones: Bringing Down the Giant Questions of Apologetics - Joe Coffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Street-level apologetics for everyday Christians.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book was written for two reasons: First, too many people think believing in Christianity means blind faith, against all evidence, the way a child believes in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Second, every few years a new book intended to undermine Christianity becomes a best seller and shakes the faith of many. Yet the arguments in these books are rarely compelling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jesus likened faith in God to a house built on a foundation. If built on sand, storms of doubt will tear the house apart. But if we build on a solid foundation, we will stand. In these pages, Joe Coffey inspects our foundation &amp;mdash; so we can know why we believe, and so we can speak of our faith to others with greater confidence and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conclusion? The Christian faith is built on a tremendous amount of credible evidence. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a scientist, an historian, an archeologist, or a philosopher to understand why belief in Jesus makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of the last time an unbeliever asked you a seemingly unanswerable question as a way of supporting their unbelief. Did you feel thwarted in your attempt to &amp;ldquo;give an account for the hope that is in you&amp;rdquo;? Smooth Stones answers six of the toughest of these questions:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How do you know God exists?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How can you be sure the Bible is authentic and true?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;If God exists, why is there evil and suffering?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t science disprove the Bible?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Aren&amp;rsquo;t all religions the same?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How can you be sure the claims of Christ are true?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joe Coffey writes in a style that is clear, winsome, and compelling. Smooth Stones will equip you with answers to some of the toughest apologetics questions a Christian can face. There is plenty of evidence to support the claims of Christianity. Smooth Stones puts much of that evidence at your fingertips and offers practical guidelines for how to unpack it in ways that are &amp;ldquo;gentle and reverent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />

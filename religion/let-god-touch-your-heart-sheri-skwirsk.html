  <title>Let God Touch Your Heart - Sheri Skwirsk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let God Touch Your Heart &lt;/i&gt;reflects the beauty of God and His love for you. The voice of God is calling you. God will give you hope, peace, comfort, and joy. His abounding love, mercy, and grace for you are indescribable.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has touched the heart of so many lives. He touched author Sheri Skwirsks heart in a big way in January 2010..Her husband, Barry, found out he had to have one of his kidneys removed. In March 2010, Barry had his surgery. God was there to guide the hands of the surgeon. The surgery was a success, and Barry is doing well.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During this time, God led Sheri to start writing. She wanted to make a difference in the lives of others, and God has shown her how. She started writing on February 28, 2010. Her husband gave her the title, &lt;i&gt;Let God Touch Your Heart&lt;/i&gt;. This seemed like the perfect choice.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not too late for God to touch your heart. No matter what your circumstances are, God is here for you. He has always been and always will be. He has chosen you to be a part of His special journey. God wants no one to perish. You are so special to Him.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will see that you come through your circumstances in life. Trust in the one that loves you completely and only wants the best for you. Capture these moments with God in your heart today.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirableif anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

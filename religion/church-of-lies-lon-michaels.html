  <title>Church of Lies - Lon Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty-six-year-old Father John Martin is the youngest priest to have been accepted into the Vatican, the most sacred city on earth. Joining the priesthood at seventeen, this is the only life hes ever known. But everything he and all the world has been led to believe is a lie. He feels he has steered the entire world astray, just as the Bible had foretold. Martin now knows the Catholic Church has been hiding the truth for nearly two thousand years.
This shocking discovery leads him to flee the Vatican with a stolen scroll that contains the evidence hes uncovered hidden safely in his suitcase. Looking to leave his sacred life behind, Martin meets Alyssa, falls in love, and they have a baby on the way. But John and his son are about to be tested in ways they could never have imagined.
As John battles with Satan, he wonders if his mothers revelation, uttered just moments before her death, is true: You have been made to suffer so you would learn kindness. You have been made to feel pain so you would learn to comfort. You have known death so you would learn to heal. You, John Martin, are a special man of God. Your life has been created so you will bring about all things." />

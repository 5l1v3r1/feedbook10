  <title>Fountain in the Valley - Dr. David Craig, Dr. Yvette Hickman Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fountain in the Valley&lt;/em&gt; is about the breaking process and the beautiful transformation of us--God&#39;s earthen vessels--into the beautiful bride of Christ. It chronicles the spiritual journey to the humility and brokenness required to be fit for the Master&#39;s service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This body of work was literally born in a dream, which is depicted on the front cover as prophetic art. Fountain in the Valley also includes original poetry. One poem eloquently describes submission to God--allowing him to lead the dance of life. Many inspirational and transparent testimonies appear throughout the book, where youll read of individuals going through purification processes. The details of real-life medical miracles are highlights of each chapter. The roles of traditional medicine and God&#39;s healing power are explored and united.&lt;/p&gt;" />

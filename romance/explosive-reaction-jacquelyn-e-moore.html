  <title>Explosive Reaction - Jacquelyn E. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Special Agent Tate Edison is a woman on a mission.  Her life hasnt gone in the direction that she wants it to.  She enjoys the challenges of the bombing investigation division but would rather be solving missing persons cases.  Every time she tries to transfer they find a way to keep her in her division.  Her office isnt exactly stress free.  One of her co-workers is an ex-boyfriend.  Then her assistant director sends her to Coronado to enlist the help of someone named Aidan Blayne.
	In Coronado, shes a little surprised to find that the address is on a naval base and that the man shes looking for is actually a Navy SEAL master chief.  After securing his cooperation, she heads home to Jacksonville to track down more leads on her serial bomber.  As soon as the man shows up, he does everything possible to get under her skin.  Offhanded remarks, starting fights between her and her ex, showing up unexpectedly.  Anything possible to get a rise out of her.  Even trying to get her case handed off to CID the military investigations division when they realize that the bomber has a military background.
	One thing she figures out about Aidan Blayne though is that he is a force to be reckoned with and when he wants results, he gets them.  After all the arguments, their attraction to one another is more than mutual and leads to more than just an explosive reaction.  They delve into each others lives finding more than a common bond.  Though they both have a problem with giving orders and expecting them to be carried out.
	Tate definitely enjoys the dance of seduction though as long as its Aidan taking the lead, corrupting her in some of the most sinful ways.  His skill for combat obviously allows him to slide past her walls of protection to steal her heart." />

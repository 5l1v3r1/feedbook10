  <title>No One But You (Silver Springs, Book 2) - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Brenda Novak welcomes you to Silver Springs, a picturesque small town in Southern California where even the hardest hearts can learn to love again…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Struggling to make ends meet after a messy divorce, Sadie Harris is at the end of her tether. Her waitressing gig isn&#39;t enough to pay the bills let alone secure primary custody of her son, Jayden, a battle she refuses to lose. Desperate, she accepts a position assisting Dawson Reed–the same Dawson Reed who recently stood trial for the murder of his adoptive parents. Joining him at his isolated farm seems risky, but Sadie is out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dawson has given small town Silver Springs plenty of reasons to be wary, but he&#39;s innocent of the charges against him. He wants to leave his painful past behind and fix up the family farm so he can finally bring his dependent sister home where she belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Sadie and Dawson&#39;s professional relationship grows into something undeniably personal, Sadie realizes there&#39;s more to Dawson than the bad boy everyone else sees–he has a good heart, one that might even be worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Secret Santa Baby - Robin Covington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tessa Stoneman hasn&#39;t been able to get long-time friend and business partner Nicholas Boone out of her head since they shared a single kiss in college. Even when she dated Nicholas&#39;s best friend. Now that she&#39;s giving up her position at GameNerdz to strike out on her own--and now that she&#39;s single--maybe it&#39;s the right time to see if there&#39;s still something between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholas knows once Tessa leaves the company she helped found, they might drift apart. Before she starts her own company in the new year, he wants to woo the woman he fell in love with during college. So he poses as her Secret Santa, sending her items from the song &quot;Santa Baby&quot;, and plans a big reveal at the company holiday party. But when his best friend wants to rekindle his romance with Tessa, will Nicholas lose his chance?&lt;/p&gt;" />

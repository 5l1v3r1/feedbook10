  <title>Storm God - Lawna Mackie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raven, is captivated by an elusive force that has followed her every step since she was the age of twelve. Years go by when she discovers Nevar is the Storm God...the one who controls the heavens above. He is the rain, wind and snow, and at first he is physically impossible to touch and hold. Raven finds him arrogant, and lacking emotion, he appears to be ruthless yet full of mystery. Raven&#39;s heart breaks with love for him, but wonders, why if he is so heartless, does he keep saving her life? For thousands of years no mere mortal ever captured his attention–until her. Raven is fearless and full of life, determined to discover the truth about her puzzling birth. Her passion and love for family entice him. She melts his frozen heart with her unconditional and undying affection. Raven is the opposite of everything he represents." />

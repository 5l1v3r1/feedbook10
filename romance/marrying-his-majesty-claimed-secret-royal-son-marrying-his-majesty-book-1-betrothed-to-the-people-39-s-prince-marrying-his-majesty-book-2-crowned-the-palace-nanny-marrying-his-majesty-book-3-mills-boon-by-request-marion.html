  <title>Marrying His Majesty: Claimed: Secret Royal Son (Marrying His Majesty, Book 1) / Betrothed: To the People&#39;s Prince (Marrying His Majesty, Book 2) / Crowned: The Palace Nanny (Marrying His Majesty, Book 3) (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Marion Lennox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Claimed: Secret Royal Son&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For just one night, sensible Lily McLachlan had thrown caution to the wind and fallen into Prince Alexandros’s arms. A year later, Alex wants to claim his secret royal son, and Lily’s hand… But Lily wants more than to be Alex’s convenient bride…she wants his heart, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Betrothed: To the People’s Prince&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Nikos Andreadis brings the reluctant Princess Athena back to Argyros to take the throne, seeing her again brings back memories of their forbidden affair that Nikos thought he’d buried. But more shocking is the secret Athena’s been carrying…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Crowned: The Palace Nanny&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raising the heir to the throne is nanny Elsa Murdoch’s dream job. Until Prince Stefanos’s arrival throws everything into chaos. Suddenly she’s required to attend royal banquets, ditching her uniform for gowns and jewels. Is Elsa being transformed from hired help to Her Royal Highness?&lt;/p&gt;

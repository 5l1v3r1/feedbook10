          &lt;strong&gt;Back by popular demand! These great value titles feature stories from Mills &amp; Boon fans&#39; favourite authors. &lt;/strong&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;Your Bed or Mine?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caley Lambert didn’t expect that her sister Emma’s wedding would turn her life upside down. But that was before she ended up in the wrong bed with the brother of the groom. When she and Jake Burton were teenagers, Jake had been the object of Caley’s most daring fantasies. But the boy is all man now. Not to mention an endlessly inventive lover!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Cold Case, Hot Bodies&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Playboy cop Dario Donato and jewellery expert Cassidy Case both want the same Manhattan house. As they fight it out, anger soon turns to passion as Dario and Cassidy embark on a scorching affair! But will they uncover the secrets the building is hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Breath Away&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security specialist Jade Broussard has busy days and lonely nights before utterly gorgeous art dealer Remy Tremaine moves into her bed, requesting her protective services. She can’t deny the talents of his hands and mouth. Melting the day’s work tensions each night is a guilty – if delicious – pleasure. Yet he sidesteps boundaries. Will she save her client’s life then say goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;

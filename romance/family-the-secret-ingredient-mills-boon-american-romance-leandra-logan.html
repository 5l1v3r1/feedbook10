          &lt;strong&gt;No longer just a crush…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was Grace North&#39;s birthday and the best gift she could&#39;ve gotten was…&lt;em&gt;Kyle McRaney?&lt;/em&gt; Okay, so it wasn&#39;t what she&#39;d asked for–at least not out loud–yet the man she had once considered her special hero was standing in her kitchen, ready to be her personal chef for the next three months. And the appearance of his precocious daughter only made Grace long for what might&#39;ve been….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kyle had always treated Grace with something akin to brotherly love, but now there was no mistaking the heat that sizzled between them. After all, Grace had gone from awkward teenager to the sexiest woman he&#39;d ever met. Could he convince this beauty to take another chance on her knight in shining armor…and his ready-made family?&lt;/p&gt;

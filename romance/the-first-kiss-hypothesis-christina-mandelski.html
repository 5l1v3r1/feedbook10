      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nora Reid believes scientific laws control everything, even love. With her grandparents&#39;epic first kiss story cemented in her brain, Nora develops a hypothesis she&#39;s determined to prove:for each person in the world, there is exactly one other person, and at first kiss, they&#39;ll experience an immediate and intense reaction.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after four years of zero-reaction kisses, she comes up with a new theory: maybe that pesky crush on her stunningly hot best friend Eli Costas is skewing her results. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She needs to get rid of him, and fast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli Costas is an injury-prone lacrosse star with a problem--the one chance he had at winning over the girl next door resulted in the most epically sucktastic first kiss ever. And now she&#39;s...trying to get rid of him? Hell no. It&#39;s time to disprove her theory and show her &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what she&#39;s missing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game.

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The First Kiss Hypothesis - Christina Mandelski</i></b> | The First Kiss Hypothesis by Christina Mandelski was cute and entertaining. I sure did want to slap Nora around a time or two, but Eli seemed like a fun dude. Their friendship is pretty adorable. I love how they treat each other and interact. Even taking the romance out of the equation, there is a deep love there. It was quite beautiful.<br /><b><i>The First Kiss Hypothesis by Christina Mandelski</i></b> | Nora and Eli have been best friends for years, even after a disastrous first kiss in the 8th grade. Nora has a hypothesis that a first kiss will be enough to tell her if she's meant to be with someone. Since the kiss with Eli did not go well, she is sure they are not meant to be more than friends. Eli, though, is determined to prove her wrong. Christina Mandelski has written one of the most realistic YA books I have read in awhile.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The First Kiss Hypothesis eBook: Mandelski ...</i></b> | Nora and Eli have been best friends for years, even after a disastrous first kiss in the 8th grade.

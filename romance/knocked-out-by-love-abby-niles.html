Hearing the marriage is over shouldn&#39;t change anything. Only an ass would make a move on a friend&#39;s ex... Except Scarlett wants help getting back in the dating game, and Brody&#39;s torn. If he helps her out, he can keep an eye on her and guard her vulnerable heart. But having the woman he&#39;s longed for for years in arms&#39; reach is hell on a man&#39;s restraint, no matter how iron strong his will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But loving Scarlett is only half the fight.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Scarlett Harris wants is to get away for a while and rethink her life after filing for divorce from her lying, cheating bastard of a husband. The gorgeous Bahamas sounds like the perfect escape, except she&#39;s booked in very resort Brody &quot;The Iron&quot; Minton is staying at for his sister&#39;s wedding. Now her ex&#39;s best friend is dogging her every move, and is a witness to her first pathetic attempts at flirting in years. If Brody isn&#39;t going to leave her alone, then she&#39;ll just recruit him to help get her reacquainted with her single self.&lt;/p&gt;" />

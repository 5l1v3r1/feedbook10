  <title>True Love and Other Disasters - Rachel Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the next Chinooks Hockey series by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Rachel Gibson, it won&amp;#8217;t be business as usual with wild-child Faith Duffy in charge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith Duffy had a very good life as the wife of a very rich, very old man. So you&amp;#8217;d think she&amp;#8217;d have an ever better life as a very rich widow. But her so-called friends now want nothing to do with her and she&amp;#8217;s about to fall back into the world she hated&amp;#8212;the world of nobodies. And the icing on top? Apparently she&amp;#8217;s now the proud owner of a hockey team. But Faith is a fighter and if it&amp;#8217;s hockey they want, it&amp;#8217;s hockey she&amp;#8217;ll give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does Faith know about hockey? That&amp;#8217;s the question on everyone&amp;#8217;s minds, especially that of Ty Savage, team captain. All he wants is his championship, and there&amp;#8217;s no way he&amp;#8217;s going to let Faith screw that up.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between juggling the line-up and fighting off their attraction, one thing&amp;#8217;s for certain: this is going to be a season to remember.&lt;/p&gt;" />

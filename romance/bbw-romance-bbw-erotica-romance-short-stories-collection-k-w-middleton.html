Barbara&#39;s reality suddenly shifts from looking for a fun past time on Valentine&#39;s day to turning herself into the arms of a stranger who even shows signs of a criminal record. This strange and intriguing Valentine adventure gives Barbara quite the challenge that she did not expect to experience on a day like this.

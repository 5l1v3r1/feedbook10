  <title>Seattle Wolf Pack Boxed Set - Kristin Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll hunger for more...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delicious alpha heroes protecting their mates at all cost? Yes, please. Take a bite out of these three, steamy full-length novels from New York Times bestseller Kristin Miller in this exclusive boxed set for a limited time only. Exquisite paranormal love stories with super hot alphas and the tenacious heroines who make these werewolves howl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devour them all in just one click.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gone With the Wolf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When CEO and alpha werewolf Drake Wilder discovers that his one true love is a secretary in his company, his primal instincts kick into overdrive. Free-spirited bartender Emelia Hudson wants nothing more than to make her Seattle-based bar succeed. Upon learning that her bar has become property of Wilder Financial, Emelia is determined to get some answers. When Drake&#39;s twin brother senses that Drake has found his match--and now inherits their father&#39;s billion dollar estate--he plans to take Emelia out. Drake vows to protect her at all costs, but he might have to pay with his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four Weddings and a Werewolf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Black, former Marine and bodyguard for the Seattle Wolf Pack, hates weddings and has no plans to enter into matrimonial misery. But when he&#39;s hired to protect a hot-to-trot wedding planner with a werewolf stalker, he&#39;s forced to put his feelings aside. Not such an easy task when the damsel can turn him on with a single smoldering glance. The chemistry between them seems fated, but with his playboy attitude, her hatred for werewolves, and a stalker lurking in the shadows, will passion be enough to keep them together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I Married a Werewolf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter Griffin, enforcing officer for the Seattle Wolf Pack, has been offered the promotion of his dreams...if he can find a wife to prove he&#39;s over his playboy ways. But Carter&#39;s already been there, done that. Faith Hamilton needs money to put her younger brother through college. Okay, and she totally wants Carter, her sexy next-door neighbor, to look at her as more than a friend. It&#39;s too bad size 12 and plain isn&#39;t his type. At all. When the two friends strike a deal to help one another out, will it spark a love neither anticipated?&lt;/p&gt;" />

No woman, he told himself, could make him feel the way he did after a successful mission&amp;#8212;no matter how beautiful she was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So why was he standing on a cold pier like a lovelorn teenager, hoping for a glimpse of Linette Collins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then he saw her, and the sight of her took his breath away. The wind whipped her lustrous dark hair about her face, and she lifted a finger to wrap a thick strand behind her ear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smart thing to do was turn around and walk away as fast as his feet would carry him. He&#39;d gotten what he wanted. One last look at her. His curiosity should be satisfied.

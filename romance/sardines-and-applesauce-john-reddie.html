  <title>Sardines and Applesauce - John Reddie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For twenty-four-year-old Paul Wilker, it seems like a dream come true. On a beautiful Sunday in March of 1964, as he works his shift at his Uncle Ikes Willow Street Auto Service in Fairdale, Massachusetts, Norma Clay pulls into the service station with car trouble. 
Paul quickly discovers her problem cannot be repaired until the following day and offers to take her home several towns away. Norma, a gorgeous model, accepts Pauls kindness, and they travel to her home. He learns that her family is wealthy, the owners of a successful publishing company. Paul is immediately attracted to Norma, and she reciprocates. But he finds himself leery of his good fortune; she could easily have any man she wants. 
As Pauls and Normas relationship progresses, Norma convinces her father to give Paul a good position at the publishing plant and even grooms him for a managers position. Paul cant believe his good fortune. He makes plans to marry Norma and take over the new plant. He will have a beautiful, sexy wife, and a high paying position. But thats not exactly the future Norma has in mind for him." />

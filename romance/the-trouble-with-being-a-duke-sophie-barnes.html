  <title>The Trouble With Being a Duke - Sophie Barnes</title>

But first he must find a bride. When he meets the most exquisite woman at his masquerade ball, he thinks his search is over . . . until the breathtaking beauty runs off. With few clues other than her figure, her scent, and the memory of her kiss, Anthony must find his mystery lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . . needs a little bit of help. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabella Chilcott can scarcely believe it: she is finally at the Kingsborough Ball. As a child, she dreamed of dancing a waltz here, and now, thanks to a gorgeous gown she&amp;#8217;s found in the attic, Isabella is living her fairytale fantasy. And she&amp;#8217;s waltzing with the Duke of Kingsborough himself! But she must escape before he discovers her secrets . . . for she is not who she pretends to be, and falling in love with Prince Charming is the last thing she can allow herself to do . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />

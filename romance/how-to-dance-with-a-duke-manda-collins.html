  <title>How to Dance With a Duke - Manda Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Dance With a Duke&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manda Collins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What&#39;s a wallflower to do when she&#39;s suddenly in need of a husband? Use all the pluck and moxie she can muster to get what she wants...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Cecily Hurston would much rather explore the antiquities of Egypt than the uncharted territory of marriage. But the rules of her father&#39;s exclusive academic society forbid her entrance unless she weds one of its members. To clear her ailing father&#39;s name of a scandalous rumor, Cecily needs to gain admission into the Egyptian Club--and is willing to marry any old dullard to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Dalton, Duke of Winterson, is anything but dull. He&#39;s a dashing and decorated war hero determined to help Cecily--even if that means looking the other way when she claims the dance card of Amelia Snow, this season&#39;s most sought-after beauty. But Lucas has a reason for wanting Cecily to join the Egyptian Club: His brother went missing during one of Lord Hurston&#39;s expeditions to Egypt. An alliance with the explorer&#39;s bluestocking daughter could bring Lucas closer to the truth about what happened...or it could lead him to a more dangerous love than either he or Cecily could have imagined....&lt;/p&gt;" />

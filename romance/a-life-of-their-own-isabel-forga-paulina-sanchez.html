  <title>A Life of Their Own - Isabel Forga, Paulina Sanchez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Somebody said once that the worst tragedy can lead to a new rewarding beginning. The mysteries of life in themselves can be rewarding enough. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Attending the San Diego Food Festival and having an enjoyable vacation was all  the Mexican chef Gabriela Estrada expected from her trip. However, as soon as she crossed the border, her existence plunged into an abyss, and a chain of distressing events hovered over her steps, pushing her to become a fugitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, in La Jolla, the talented violin player Katherine Vaughan, heiress to the Fifth Diamond Hotels empire, spent her days between her passion for music and her charities, trapped in a marriage and a society that suffocated her souls yearning for truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When these two paths crossed, revealing endless possibilities of salvation and rebirth, the unthinkable became reachable, confusion turned into certainty and decisions could no longer be avoided. The time came to choose between abiding by the standards or fighting for a life of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paulina Snchez (Mexico City 1982- ) &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After graduating with high honors from the Universidad Anhuac del Sur with a major in Literature, she started working as a History, English and Literature teacher. She currently works as a writer and translator for several wellknown media corporations. &lt;/p&gt;" />

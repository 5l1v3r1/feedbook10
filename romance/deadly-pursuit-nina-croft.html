  <title>Deadly Pursuit - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Breaking assassin Jonathon Decker out of a maximum-security prison on Trakis One seemed like a good idea at the time. Now, pursued across space by the two most powerful factions in the universe, the crew of El Cazador are having second thoughts. They&#39;d like to give him back. Unfortunately, that is no longer an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon is used to working alone. Now, he&#39;s stuck on the space cruiser El Cazador until he can work out just what he&#39;s supposed to know that puts him on everybody&#39;s most-wanted-dead list. He&#39;s not happy that the crew includes a runaway priestess with designs on his virtue-such as it is. Jon likes women, but he gave up the role of protector a long time ago, and Alexia, High Priestess of the Church of Everlasting Life, is an accident waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After twenty-four excruciatingly boring years of doing her duty, Alex is finally having some fun. She never meant to run away-it was a rash impulse-and she means to go back-eventually. But first, she&#39;s going to squeeze enough excitement out of the situation to last her a lifetime. And what could be more exciting than a stunningly gorgeous werewolf? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Church are chasing their missing priestess, and the Collective are pursuing their escaped assassin. Being hunted has never been more deadly...or more fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Dark Desires series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Break Out&lt;br&gt;* Deadly Pursuit&lt;br&gt;* Death Defying&lt;br&gt;* Temporal Shift&lt;br&gt;* Blood and Metal&lt;br&gt;* Flying Through Fire&lt;/p&gt;" />

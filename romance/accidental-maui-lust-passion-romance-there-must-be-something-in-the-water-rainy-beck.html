  <title>Accidental Maui: Lust, Passion, Romance,  there must be something in the water... - Rainy Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When advertising executive Doug Rivers finds himself divorced and alone, he buries himself in his work, trying to forget Gail, his wife of thirteen years and the only woman he thought he could ever love. Meddling friends set him up on a string of blind dates to take his mind off her, but none work out until he&amp;#39;s introduced to the attractive and professional Cynthia Davis. His suspicions are soon realized, though, and he&amp;#39;s forced to take action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his best friend, David Kage, insists Doug join him on a trip to Maui for a little diversion, he&amp;#39;s reluctant, and once there immediately realizes it was a mistake, until a chance encounter sets his future on a new course. When his past catches up with him, however, the deceptions of those he once trusted threaten not only his chance at happiness, but his very life as well. In this tropical island paradise, he finds himself in the battle of his life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stretching from the pristine reaches of the San Juan Islands to the sun-drenched beaches of Hawaii, Accidental Maui is a story of hope and rediscovery that answers the question of what&amp;#39;s really important in life, and may, in the end, renew your faith in the power of love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

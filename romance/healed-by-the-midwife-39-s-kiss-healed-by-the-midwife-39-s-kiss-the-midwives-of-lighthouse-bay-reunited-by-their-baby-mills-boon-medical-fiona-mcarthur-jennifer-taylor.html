        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Finn can’t imagine loving anyone again…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;…but could one woman change that forever?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After Dr Finn Foley’s wife abandoned him and their adorable baby daughter, he threw himself into being a father. But when he meets a kindred spirit in widowed midwife Catrina Thomas, he can’t resist getting to know her better. One sizzling kiss later, the happiness Finn has been searching for finally seems within his grasp…if only he’s willing to claim it!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He’s back to claim his family…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;But can Beth trust him with her heart?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GP Beth Andrews has a wonderful job at The Larches Practice and a baby girl she adores. The only thing missing is her husband! Now Callum O’Neill is back and he’s stunned and delighted to discover he has a much wanted child. He’s determined to renew his marriage with Beth, but can she trust that this time he’ll stay forever?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Eloping With The Princess - Robyn DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For as long as she can remember, Isabel Crisp has lived at St. Bartholomew&#39;s School for Girls. Until, that is, she&#39;s torn from her bed and taken to the home of Viscount Jason Ellis. A member of the Brotherhood of the Sword, Jason is duty-bound to protect damsels in distress, and apparently, Isabel is in great jeopardy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jason agreed to protect Isabel, he had no idea what exactly that would entail. But when she turns out to be the last remaining royal of a small island nation, caught up in a plot to usurp Victoria&#39;s throne, both of their worlds tip upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping Isabel safe from those who would cause her harm is challenge enough. Keeping his hands to himself amidst the passion igniting between them turns out to be an even bigger challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Brotherhood of the Sword series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Undercover with the Earl&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Dueling With the Duke&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Eloping With The Princess&lt;/p&gt;" />

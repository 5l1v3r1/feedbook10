          &lt;strong&gt;Introduce yourself to Mills &amp; Boon’s sexiest series yet!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Me Need by Katee Robert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needing money Trish Livingston accepts a job from her brother. She’s even willing to put up with his best friend and business partner, the notoriously grumpy, but gorgeous, Cameron O’Clery. Have these complete opposites met their match and will they realise there is a fine line between hate and lust…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between The Lines by Lauren Hawkeye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When writer Jo Marchande bumps into her childhood love, Theo, he is no longer the boy of her dreams but a gorgeous, hard bodied man filled with raw sensuality. Theo is offering Jo the two things she wants most—a big break for her writing career and a chance to experience all the sexy, kinky things she&#39;s only ever written about!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innocent Seduction by Clare Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in an underground bar, Millie Davis becomes fascinated by the handsome billionaire barrister Michael Brophy and issues him with a proposition: take her virginity, in a no-strings one-night-stand! Only Michael wants more than to introduce Millie to sex – he wants to teach her what her body is capable of, one delicious night at a time!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Wicked Week by Nicola Marsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s been six years since multi-millionaire tech genius Brock Olsen has seen Jayda York, but one glimpse of those curves and he&#39;s transported back to that steamy night they shared. Now Jayda’s back with a business proposition – Brock&#39;s expertise during the day – and mind-blowing sex at night…but for one week only!&lt;/p&gt;

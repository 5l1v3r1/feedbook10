  <title>Second Chance Christmas - Travis Irwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the loss of his precious wife behind him, Travis has no interest in getting involved with any woman, let alone one his friends know nothing about. But when Travis comes on Haiyan Morris after driving her SUV into a rock filled ditch, Travis can&#39;t help but notice she&#39;s a desirable woman, as warm and funny as his deceased wife was. When he looked at her and her children, it was as though he was looking back at his previous life.
International stewardess Haiyan Morris would never have returned to her ex-husbands small Missouri hometown if she hadn&#39;t come up with the scheme to seek employment with another airline after the economic crash and the following layoff. Her daughters had never met her missing husbands parents and Christmas seemed to be the perfect time to seek their assistance. They also solved a problem for having someone to watch them while she applied for her job in Kansas City.
Travis McNeil knew that Haiyan and her daughters were special the minute he pulled them out of the demolished SUV and took them to his cabin in the woods. Little did he know that the oldest daughter had her eyes set on him as a surrogate father and would go to any means to achieve her goal. He also knew that if Haiyan left, that would just become another obstacle in his path to finding happiness.
Then one night and one intervention from the other side sent Haiyan into the arms of Travis on the road to realizing that each offered what the other needed and desired.... It&#39;s not long before Travis and Haiyan are keeping each other warm on cold December nights. But it&#39;s going to take a Christmas miracle for Travis to trust in love a second time.
But with so many obstacles separating them, can Haiyan and Travis find a way to get together one magical country Christmas? Could Traviss mentor and his wifes spirit provide the magical difference to teach both lovers that failure and set backs are not permanent and success is only a few beliefs away Could the village of Sunset Cove teach another family that sometimes when the timing is right, things do happen according to fates intervention?" />

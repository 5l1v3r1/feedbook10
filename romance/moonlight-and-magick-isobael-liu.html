  <title>Moonlight and Magick - Isobael Liu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All she wanted was a quiet, normal life.  .  .but you don&#39;t always get what you want. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lilian Quinn came to this remote town to start a new life. No one knew she had escaped from Custodes Secreti, a secret organization dedicated to using people with strange abilities for their own ends. All she wanted was a quiet, normal existence. Even if it meant living a lie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Matthias Romulus was content to be the Alpha werewolf of the local pack, until he bumped into Lilian. Powerfully drawn to her, he stepped in to help her when the Custodes Secreti tracked her down. He didn&#39;t know she was trained in much more than waiting tables. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With Lilian&#39;s murderous ex-boyfriend coming after her and secret agents on her trail, the strange dreams she&#39;s been having are only the beginning. Matthias has problems of his own with his pack giving ultimatums. Can a psychic woman and an alpha wolf come together to resolve the issues of their hearts&amp;#8212;and the issues of their continued survival?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;71,998 Words" />

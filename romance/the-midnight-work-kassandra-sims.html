  <title>The Midnight Work - Kassandra Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christmas is a time of forgiveness -- so when Sophie Aubrey&#39;s date, a sexy and mysterious artist named Olivier, turns her into a vampire, she decides to forgive him. Especially since being a vampire is just as cool as she always thought it would be.  But there are a few drawbacks she never expected, like zombies, sleazy French alchemists, inexplicable and contradictory fairies -- and her roommates: one has abandoned Chicago and her cat for the Fairy Lands, and the other reacted to vampirism by embracing it with both hands (and fangs) and gorging herself on human blood. Ick-o-rama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, Olivier seems to believe that Sophie is his true love from a thousand years ago.  Sophie can forgive that too, because when Olivier touches her, the whole world falls away -- but what she can&#39;t forgive is that he didn&#39;t tell her the whole story, like how a crazy death fairy has a vendetta against her. This has Sophie vacillating between entertainment at the fairy&#39;s pretensions and being scared out of her mind that someone who calls himself the God of Death has got it in for her soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Olivier -- and the sleazy French alchemist, who turns out to be a vampire&#39;s best friend -- Sophie thinks she can defeat the death fairy. And if she can&#39;t, not only will she and Olivier have no future, she&#39;s pretty sure that the whole world is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who says holidays can&#39;t be fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

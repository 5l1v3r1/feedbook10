  <title>Mistresses: In His Bed: The Billionaire&#39;s Trophy / Strictly Temporary / Whose Bed Is It Anyway? (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Lynne Graham, Robyn Grady, Natalie Anderson</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;The Billionaire’s Trophy by Lynne Graham&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;On his arm…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is his intern’s photo doing on an escort website?&lt;/em&gt; Bastian Christou doesn’t know if he’s more surprised by her double life, or her stunning photo – she’s kept those curves well hidden! He has an ex-fiancée to keep at bay and Emmie Marshall might just be the best armour money can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;And in his bed?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emmie is outraged when Bastian, her uncompromising boss, confronts her. She had no idea her photo was online. But his cheque’s been cashed and he’s come to collect his prize… A weekend in Greece. With her. Alone. Their relationship might be fake, but Emmie’s trepidation is all too real!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Strictly Temporary by Robyn Grady&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Discovering an abandoned baby in the backseat of a taxi was not on hotelier Zack Harrison’s agenda. Luckily, a stunning stranger comes to his aid—and piques his interest… Next thing Zack knows, a snowstorm strands the trio in his luxurious Colorado cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trinity Matthews wants to resist Zack’s advances, but his care and concern for her and the baby soon has her melting. As the snow falls and the heat sizzles, it’s not long before Trinity’s sleeping in his bed. And she finds herself wondering if their temporary arrangement could have permanent effects.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Whose Bed is it Anyway? by Natalie Anderson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returning home after a daring rescue mission, all James Wolf can think of is sleep. So he’s furious to find a beautiful stranger curled up in his king-size bed! No woman ever normally gets between his sheets without prior invitation – who does she think she is?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Disgraced celebrity Caitlin Moore was offered a place to stay and she won’t give it up, not with the paparazzi outside baying for her blood! Reluctantly, she agrees to share the apartment with James, but with enough electricity to short-circuit the whole of Manhattan, keeping to their own sides of the bed might prove impossible…&lt;/p&gt;

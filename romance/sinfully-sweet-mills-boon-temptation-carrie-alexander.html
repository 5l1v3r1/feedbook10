          &lt;strong&gt;THE BAD BOY&#39;S ABOUT TO MEET HIS MATCH…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mackenzie Bliss is thrilled that her sister&#39;s life has turned out so well. Now, if only Mackenzie could have the same luck! Thanks to their bet, she&#39;s opened a new penny-candy store, dumped her lukewarm boyfriend and &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; her hair! But when a sexy man from her past shows up at her home one night, Mackenzie&#39;s positive life couldn&#39;t be any different.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the eve of his ten-year reunion, Devlin Brandt never thought he&#39;d see anyone from high school again. He was always called the bad boy, and rightfully so. But Mackenzie never treated him that way. Deep down he knew she had a thing for him, but he didn&#39;t want to hurt her. Now Mackenzie&#39;s a full-grown woman…and Devlin can&#39;t stay away from her, even if it means getting them &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; into some sinfully sweet trouble!&lt;/p&gt;

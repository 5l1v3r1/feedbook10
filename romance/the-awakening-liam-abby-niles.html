      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Awakening: Liam by Abby Niles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shifter, Liam Doyle knows Hell. At least he believed he did. The night he feels his mate die, he learns how very wrong he was. Nothing he&#39;d struggled with since Ava&#39;s rejection compares to the emptiness that fills his soul by her death. Lost in his grief, he&#39;s taken by surprise and drugged.  When he wakes, everything changes. Nothing is what it seems, and someone is dead set on making him pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ava Michaels is taken captive, she&#39;s thrust into a dark and terrifying world along with the man she was forced to leave behind. While being near Liam again is heartbreaking, the motive behind her kidnapping is gradually revealed. The more she learns, the more she worries Liam isn&#39;t the man she believed him to be. He has enemies willing to do anything to extract their revenge. Can their love survive a crazy man&#39;s vengeance?&lt;/p&gt;" />

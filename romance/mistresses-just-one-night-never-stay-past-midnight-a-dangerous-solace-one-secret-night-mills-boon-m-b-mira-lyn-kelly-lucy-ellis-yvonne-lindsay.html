  <title>Mistresses: Just One Night: Never Stay Past Midnight / A Dangerous Solace / One Secret Night (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Mira Lyn Kelly, Lucy Ellis, Yvonne Lindsay</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never Stay Past Midnight&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are so wrong for me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Levi had to agree–he was. He was leaving Chicago in a few short weeks. He didn&#39;t do commitment–ever. But everything about this night, this girl, was so good. So right. Until at 11:59 p.m. she got out of his bed, got dressed and left!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What had he done? Things had hardly started and she was off! Yet he was bored with simpering women he couldn&#39;t get rid of. Elise was a breath of fresh air. How was he going to find her…and get her back in his bed–for the whole night this time? It seemed Mr. Levi-and-Leave-Them might have found the one woman to leave him begging for more….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Dangerous Solace&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Italy&#39;s most desirable playboy, Gianluca Benedetti, might not initially recognise Ava Lord as the beautiful bridesmaid who stole his breath and shared his bed all those years ago, but one glimpse of the curves beneath her buttoned-up clothes and it all comes rushing back!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a steamy kiss between them ignites a media firestorm, Gianluca whisks Ava off to the Amalfi Coast to minimise the PR scandal. Exploring the re-ignited passion between them, Ava realises the danger of opening her heart. Because the closer Gianluca gets…the more cracks in her carefully constructed armour appear.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;One Secret Night&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ethan Masters learns his family&#39;s explosive secret, it sends him reeling…straight into an uncharacteristic one-night stand. Too bad he&#39;ll never see Isobel Fyfe again….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until she shows up as his winery&#39;s newest hire. Now Ethan&#39;s in trouble. Isobel is everything he&#39;s not—a free spirit with no commitments—and she won&#39;t be controlled. How can he trust her to keep his secret? How can he keep his distance? With his family at stake, Ethan&#39;s playing with fire…but he wants Isobel. And he&#39;ll do anything to keep her quiet…and in his bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Spun - Catherine McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this funny and touching novella, bestselling author Catherine McKenzie returns to the story of Amber Sheppard, It Girl and celebrity train wreck from McKenzie’s reader-favourite novel, &lt;em&gt;Spin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life has been rough for starlet Amber since leaving rehab. She’s been two years sober, but no one seems to believe her -- not the gossip media, not casting agents, and most certainly not her spotlight-loving parents. With her friendships  ruined by betrayal and her career at a standstill, Amber’s just trying to get her life back on track. It doesn’t  help that her former love, movie star Connor Parks, keeps trying to draw Amber back in, not just to their relationship but to his hard-partying ways. One fateful night, Amber breaks down and agrees to join him on board his private jet as it readies for take-off -- a decision  that will change her life forever and expose her to a whole new level of scrutiny and heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Short, sharp, sophisticated, you&#39;ll want to read it all in one breath. &lt;em&gt;Spun&lt;/em&gt; is the next best thing, and should vault Catherine McKenzie to the top of the charts again, right where she belongs.”—Gwendolen Gross, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;When She Was Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve loved everything Catherine McKenzie has ever written, but this one tops them all. The voice is lively, the dialogue is snappy, and the pace is perfect. &lt;em&gt;Spun&lt;/em&gt; is a story I’ll read over and over.”—Tracey Garvis Graves, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;On the Island&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Covet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For anyone who read &lt;em&gt;Spin&lt;/em&gt; and wondered, ‘What happened next?’ &lt;em&gt;Spun&lt;/em&gt; is a short story that is long on compelling, believable drama. An arresting tale that pits impulse against intellect and desire against need, &lt;em&gt;Spun&lt;/em&gt; explores the importance of caring as much about tomorrow as today. Its suspenseful conclusion will make your hold your breath through the very end. I loved it.”—Therese Walsh, author of &lt;em&gt;The Moon Sisters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last Will of Moira Leahy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

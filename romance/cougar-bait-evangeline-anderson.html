      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Return to Cougarville as the town&#39;s mayor, and resident Alpha cougar, matches wits with a trauma surgeon who sparks his animal instincts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samantha Becker is a busy and talented trauma surgeon with no time for nonsense. Her sister may have a special Shifter Gene, but Sammie is fairly certain she doesn&#39;t have it, and she&#39;s happy with her life the way it is. She doesn&#39;t need the complicated Shifter lifestyle, and she certainly doesn&#39;t need Liam Keller: Alpha cougar, Mayor of Cougarville and undercover billionaire. She hates him, but Liam is unable to get the curvy surgeon out of his head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Shifter world isn&#39;t ready to let Sammie go. She&#39;s being stalked by someone who&#39;s desperate for Shifter hormones, and Liam takes it upon himself to protect Sammie from harm. Things begin heating up between Sammie and Liam, but will they have to succumb to their inner animals in order to save Sammie&#39;s life? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evangeline Anderson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Cougar Bait &lt;/i&gt;is fun, sexy and will take readers on an emotional thrill ride.&lt;/p&gt;" />

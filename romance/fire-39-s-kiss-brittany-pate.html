  <title>Fire&#39;s Kiss - Brittany Pate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Embyr tends her tavern while keeping her dangerous parentage a secret, until she&amp;#39;s attacked by a hellhound and saved by one of the most feared men in history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the last eight hundred years, Ryder McLennon, the infamous leader of Death&amp;#39;s Horsemen, has used his army to hunt the vampire who killed his wife. He&amp;#39;s earned a reputation as a murderous madman. But in Embyr, he discovers something that could turn the tide of battle in his favor. Her control over fire can reduce an enemy to ash and her flippant disregard of him heats his blood in ways no one else ever has. She&amp;#39;s beautiful, powerful and completely different from her violence-loving brethren.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Embyr finds herself thrust into a war she wants no part of, targeted by a vicious vampire because of her cooperation with Ryder. As she learns to wield her demonic powers without letting the madness of her race overcome her, she also has to fight her attraction to a killer bent on her seduction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

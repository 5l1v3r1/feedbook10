          &lt;strong&gt;SHE STRUCK A MARRIAGE BARGAIN WITH A MAN SHE DIDN&#39;T KNOW….&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The fierce, raven-haired stranger who rescued her from a stampede was as untamed as the mustangs that cautious Laura Walker had come to the reservation to study. So why wasn&#39;t she terrified when Shane Bearclaw swept her into his saddle, into his arms? And why did she impulsively agree to a marriage with this magnificent, intimidating male?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shane had vowed to keep custody of his little sister. But was that reason enough to wed a skittish blonde as wary as the mustangs he wrangled? Or was fate misleading them both into believing that a mismatched pair…was made for each other?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Down This Road - Kelli Dawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They say you can never go home, and for high-powered Chicago attorney Charlie McIntire, that is perfectly fine. She left home the day she turned eighteen and never planned to return. But at twenty-nine, she finds herself running back to the ranch, the only place she can think of that will help her face an unexpected turn of events. Charlie tries to settle back into the quiet pace of country living, unsure of everything except the fact that she still hates shoveling manure. Life on the ranch is uneventful, and without the distractions of the city, Charlie forced to deal with things shed rather avoid: what shes going to do with the rest of her life; the unfinished business between her and an ex-boyfriend; and most of all, the event that will change her life forever. 
	Down This Road chronicles Charlies journey of self-discovery. It explores how the past shapes the present, how difficult it can be to change patterns of behavior, and how sometimes, learning your lesson might come just a little too late." />

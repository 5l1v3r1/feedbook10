  <title>Rogue in Texas - Lorraine Heath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He was the wrong man for the job in every way but one . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grayson Rhodes, the illegitimate son of a duke, heads to America to prove his worth and earn his fortune. But post-Civil War Texas seems more like hell than a land of opportunity, especially when he finds himself working the cotton fields of no-nonsense Abbie Westland. Abbie, with her fiery determination, is wildly different from the fragile beauties Grayson knew at home . . . but there is a tender yearning he can see just below her tough exterior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbie works her fingers to the bone day-in and day-out, and she needs the help of a few good farmhands. Though skeptical of the polished Englishman when he arrives, she soon discovers a man with a resolve to succeed that matches her own. As the long, hot days turn to heated, passionate nights, they dare to dream of a future together.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>One Year with Dicky - Elizabeth Aguilar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dicky and Lizzie, despite being in their sixties and living alone for almost twenty years, got their lives intertwined-something which they both acknowledge as destined by God. 
Conservative Lizzie grew up in a household where sex was not mentioned in daily conversations, while modern-day Dickys outlook on the matter was the opposite. 
Every day, he sent Lizzie text messages of sexual jokes, which caused their budding friendship to be turbulent. But after months of daily exchange of text messages, they slowly chipped away the edges of their rough relationship, sculpting a beautiful friendship, such that not a day passed by without one missing the other. 
Then something suddenly happened to Dicky. He fell into depression, shutting himself away from the outside. Will it be the end of Dicky and Lizzie?" />

  <title>Wolf&#39;s Hunger - Carrie Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes the best things happen in the most unexpected places…&lt;br/&gt;
Lilian, a curvy Brazilian brunette, is about to get her Master&#39;s degree in the States when a job position opens in a large local company. She decides it’s worth trying and sends them her resumé. When they call her for an interview, Lil can barely believe her luck! But the best is yet to come, and the surprises are just starting…&lt;br/&gt;
Alec Wolfe is the Chief Director of Wolfe Enterprises, as well as the alpha werewolf of the local pack. Divided between the restless search for his destined mate, the pressure of the other wolves for him to have pups, the full moon approaching, and the endless business meetings, this alpha just wants this Friday to end so he can relax… but suddenly there is a problem involving interviews for a new member of the HR area, thanks to the pretty, but futile and (pretty much) useless secretary that he himself hired. With his luck, things can only get worse… unless it is finally time for this lone wolf to find his soulmate.&lt;br/&gt;

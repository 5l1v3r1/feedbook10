  <title>Fat Chance (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Deborah Blumenthal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Plus-size Maggie O&#39;Leary is America&#39;s Anti-Diet Sweetheart. Her informed column about the pitfalls of dieting is the one sane voice crying out against the dietocracy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She is perfectly happy with who she is and the life she leads. Until she gets the chance to spend some quality time with Hollywood&#39;s hottest star. Maggie knows she can&#39;t exactly show up looking like…well, herself. So she swallows her words and vows to become the &lt;em&gt;skinniest&lt;/em&gt; fat advocate Tinseltown has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Swearing her trusted assistant to silence, Maggie embarks on a &quot;secret&quot; makeover. From showdowns with her boss, who is convinced his star columnist is losing her edge–er, girth–to run-ins with her closest male friend, the trip through the famed red door of beauty is anything but graceful. But despite her doubts about abandoning the comfortable life she&#39;s known–not to mention deceiving legions of loyal readers who still think of her as their champion, L.A.-bound Maggie is hell-bent on getting her just &quot;desserts&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bursting with wit, insight and humor, Deborah Blumenthal&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Fat Chance&lt;/em&gt; is a guilt-free pleasure that is good to the last page!&lt;/p&gt;

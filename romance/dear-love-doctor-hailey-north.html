  <title>Dear Love Doctor - Hailey North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;...so give up on him and get on with your life. He will only break your heart, My conclusion as to his ability to commit is...Diagnosis Terminal!&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Love Doctor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daffodil &amp;#34;Daffy&amp;#34; Landry stared at her words of advice to the lovelorn and pressed her hand against her breast. Was she writing about this unknownCasanova...or about herself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broken Hearts Mended Here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnosis Terminal!&lt;/em&gt; Charming, sexy, and self-made Hunter James isn&amp;#39;t one to back away from a challenge. Slapping his copy of the &lt;em&gt;New Orleans Crescent&lt;/em&gt; against his thigh, he approached the newspaper&amp;#39;s outer office. How dare that anonymous, autocratic, and insufferable Love Doctor label him as incapable of commitment? Did she ever consider that he simply hasn&amp;#39;t met the right woman? He&amp;#39;ll uncover the author&amp;#39;s identity and give her a piece of his mind. But first, appreciating an opportunity when it presents itself, he&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;got &lt;/em&gt;to meet the beckoning blonde behind the reception desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knows? Maybe the Love Doctor has led him to the woman of his dreams after all...&lt;/p&gt;" />

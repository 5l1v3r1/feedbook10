Phoenix will have to go on a wild goose chase to find her biological parents, who are legendary supers, and will take along the ride an old flame, a few best friends, and a cybertronic teddy bear with the anatomy of a two year old.  On her journey she will discover that there are things in her past that not even she will believe can determine her future.  As she rids herself of her old identity she will have no choice but to accept the identity that is only new to her.  As well as a determined new flame." />

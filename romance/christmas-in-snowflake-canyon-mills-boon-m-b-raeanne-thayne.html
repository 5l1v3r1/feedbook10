  <title>Christmas In Snowflake Canyon (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - RaeAnne Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Holiday gifts don’t always come in expected packages… especially in the town of Hope’s Crossing!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No one has ever felt sorry for Genevieve Beaumont. After all, she has everything money can buy. That is, until she discovers her fiancé has been two-timing her and she’s left with two choices: marry the philanderer to please her controlling father or be disinherited and find a means to support herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Genevieve’s salvation appears in the most unlikely of prospects: Dylan Caine, a sexy, wounded war vet whose life is as messy as hers. Dylan’s struggling to adjust after his time in Afghanistan and the last thing he needs is a spoiled socialite learning about the real world for the first time. True, she may have unexpected depths and beauty to match.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he knows he could never be the man she needs… and she knows he could never be the man she thinks she wants. So why are they each hoping that a Christmas miracle will prove them both wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Reading these stories of small-town life engages the reader’s heart and emotions, inspiring hope and the belief that miracles are possible’ —No.1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber&lt;/p&gt;

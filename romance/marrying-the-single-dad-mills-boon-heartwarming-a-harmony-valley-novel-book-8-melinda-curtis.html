        &lt;p&gt;A man called Joe&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Building a new life for himself and his pre-teen daughter brings Joe Messina home to Harmony Valley. That, and showing his town that the onetime bad boy is now a responsible single father. His first move is to get his grandfather’s defunct garage up and running. Except now he’s got the FBI poking around and a beautician with her eye on the abandoned auto parts. An artist who’s happiest turning rusty junk into sought-after treasure, San Francisco transplant Brittany Lambridge is making Joe think they can create something rare and special together. But he has unfinished family business that could jeopardize his fresh start. Is Joe ready to believe in himself as fiercely as Brittany&#39;s beginning to believe in him?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My Name Is Mohammad - Paul P.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is November 20, 1977, when Mohammad first gazes at the snowcovered airstrip at JFK International Airport. Anxiety overwhelms him as he stares at the gray sky. He is now two oceans away from his ordinary life in Pakistan. As Mohammad makes his way through immigration and then on to a plane destined for Dallas, Texas, he realizes his life will never be the same again.&lt;p&gt;
In a state where cowboy hats and drawls are the way of life, everything seems strange to Mohammad. With the help of his friend Rashid, Mohammad finds work at a factory. Despite his struggles to fit into a new culture, all seems welluntil a blonde co-worker catches his eye. Carla is opinionated, independent, and equally as infatuated with Mohammad. But there is only one problemCarla is Christian. Soon after Mohammad and Carla fall in love, he reveals a secret past; almost immediately, their religious and cultural differences begin to cause a rift in their relationship.&lt;p&gt;
Just as Mohammad finally finds love and acceptance, Carla walks away. Now Mohammad must decide whether he is willing to risk his faith, his values, and his family in order to win Carla back." />

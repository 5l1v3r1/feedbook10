  <title>The Smart One - Ellen Meister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bev is the Smart One, who finally leaves her artistic ambitions in chalk dust (and her humor-impaired husband in the arms&amp;#8212;and legs&amp;#8212;of his nubile prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233;e) to become a schoolteacher. Clare is the Pretty One, who married well and seems to be living a designer version of the suburban dream. Joey is the Wild One, struggling to stay clean and sober now that she&#39;s used up her fifteen minutes of fame as a one-hit-wonder rock star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They love each other but mix like oil, water, and hundred-proof gin . . . a combination that threatens to combust over family tensions, suspected infidelities, a devastating accident, a stunning confession, and the sudden reappearance of their handsome, now all-grown-up former neighbor, Kenny Waxman, who&#39;s back in town making his mark as a TV comedy writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems they&#39;ll never understand where their differences begin and their own destructive tendencies end. Then it happens: the sisters discover a decades-old body stuffed inside an industrial drum and begin a bold, heartbreaking, and sometimes hilarious journey that will either bring them together . . . or tear them apart for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />

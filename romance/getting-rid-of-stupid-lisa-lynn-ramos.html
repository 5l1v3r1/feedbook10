  <title>Getting Rid of Stupid - Lisa Lynn Ramos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a community where &lt;i&gt;mujeres&lt;/i&gt;womenare measured by the men they wed, Jeanette is a single Hispanic radio host who is defying the status quo. But her sister Ana has a different plan. Obsessed over finding Jeanette a man before she hits &lt;i&gt;cuarenta&lt;/i&gt;the big four-oAna lines up a blind date; suddenly, Jeanettes guarded world is turned upside down.
For the past six years, Jeanette has dated enough losers to last a millennium, but after she meets Costa, she forgets what it is like to be lonely. As Jeanette finally lets herself experience security in the arms of a real macho man, her friend Santi is listening to her husband tell her he is leaving their marriage. Meanwhile, Nancy is embroiled in a clandestine relationship with her teacher and is the victim of his manipulative actions. As the friends each confront the unique issues that accompany their romantic relationships, they become immersed in a tapestry of deceptions that leads them on a path to discovering the truth not only about their lovers, but also themselves.
In this lighthearted and charming romance novel, three women learn that the journey to a fairytale ending is as unpredictable and complicated as love itself." />

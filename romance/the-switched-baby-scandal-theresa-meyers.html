  <title>The Switched Baby Scandal - Theresa Meyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When single mom Taylor Lawrence discovers the hospital accidentally sent her home with the wrong baby five years ago, she&#39;s stunned. Now the headstrong and handsome biological father wants his child back. But Emily is her daughter, and Taylor isn&#39;t about to give her up without a fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Widower Reece Wallace believed his life was over when he lost his wife and daughter in a tragic accident. Then he finds out about Emily. He&#39;ll never forget his first daughter, but maybe life was giving him a second chance. He could never have anticipated the fiery woman on the other side of this custody battle, though, or how she&#39;d stir feelings in him long dormant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the media storm surrounding the hospital&#39;s mistake intensifies, Taylor and Reece find there&#39;s more to sort out than custody of Emily, and that sometimes love can be found in the most unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;" />

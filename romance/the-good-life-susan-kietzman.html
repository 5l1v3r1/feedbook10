  <title>The Good Life - Susan Kietzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between workouts, charity events, and shopping, Ann Barons keeps her days as full as her walk-in closets. She shares an immaculate house with her CEO husband, Mike, and their two teenagers, Nate and Lauren. It&#39;s a luxurious life, far from her homespun childhood on a farm in eastern Pennsylvania.  .  .which is why Ann is wary when her elderly parents ask to move in temporarily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ann prepares in the way she knows best--hiring decorators and employing a full-time nurse for her dementia-stricken father. But nothing can prepare her for the transformations ahead. Soon, her mother Eileen is popping in to prepare soups and roasts in Ann&#39;s underused kitchen, while the usually surly Nate forms an alliance with his ailing grandfather. Lauren blossoms under Eileen&#39;s guidance, and even workaholic Mike finds time to attend high-school football games. But it&#39;s Ann who must make the biggest leap, and confront the choices and values that have kept her floating on life&#39;s surface for so long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timely, poignant, and wise, &lt;i&gt;The Good Life&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply satisfying and beautifully written story about the complex relationships between parents and children--and the gap that often lies between what we seek, and what will truly make us whole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The moving story of a family&#39;s rebirth through the simple but profound acts of daily kindness and sacrifice.&quot; &amp;#8211;Holly Chamberlin, author of &lt;i&gt;Last Summer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Susan Kietzman&lt;/b&gt; is a Connecticut native. She has a bachelor&#39;s degree in English from Connecticut College and a master&#39;s degree in journalism from Boston University. She has worked in both magazine and newspaper publishing and currently writes grants for the Mystic Seaport Museum. &lt;i&gt;The Good Life&lt;/i&gt; is her first novel. She lives with her family in Mystic, CT." />

  <title>Bound to Serve - Julie Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Condor earned his reputation by being Delta Star&#39;s ultimate secret agent. He&#39;s untouchable, unstoppable, and he always nails his targets. But no matter how many times he&#39;s saved the world, he&#39;s a ghost who will never take credit. He works best alone, and to continue to protect his country, he&#39;ll stay alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Delta Star field agent Bridget Jamison is obsessed with capturing Simon Perez, the elusive terrorist responsible for her ex-fiancé&#39;s death. When the Delta Star director hands the case over to Condor, a mesmerizing ghost agent who has the power to make her weak in the knees with one intense look, Bridget agrees to be Condor&#39;s partner so that she&#39;s not dropped from the case and her chance for justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they&#39;re on a mission to infiltrate a dangerous criminal organization and capture Perez. It&#39;s up to Condor to keep this beautiful, determined agent out of harm&#39;s way, and to keep their explosive passion contained long enough not to risk their cover...and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>MARION MARLOWE’S TRUE HEART or How a Daughter Forgave - Grace Shirley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1900 and after arriving penniless in New York, Marion Marlowe has just been accepted into a trainee nurse position at Charity Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her twin-sister, Dollie, has her eyes on a typist position, also in New York, and had also turned down Silas Johnson&amp;rsquo;s proposal of marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
Tom, Marrion&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law, has borrowed $500 off Marion&amp;rsquo;s parents, which forced them to take out a mortgage. In the meantime, Silas bought the mortgages off the bank with ulterior motives in mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom refuses to repay the $500 leaving Marion&amp;rsquo;s parents in a tough financial spot. Out of spite Silas Johnson decides to foreclose on Marion&amp;rsquo;s parent&amp;rsquo;s farm in the hope that it may force Dollie to agree to marry him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On hearing the news, Marion immediately returns home and demands to be told why Tom borrowed the money. But what scrape did Tom get himself into, for in 1900, $500 was a great deal of money and will Marion be able to help her parents avoid the pending foreclosure?&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>His Millionaire Maid (Entangled Lovestruck) - Coleen Kwan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They say be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. For Nina Beaumont, there&#39;s nothing she wants more than to prove she&#39;s more than just her name. She&#39;s tired of being treated differently because of who her family is. As far as she&#39;s concerned, money ruins everything. So when a rogue duck causes her to crash her car outside a small town, sending it and her belongings spiraling into the watery abyss, she realizes fate has given her a chance to show she can make it on her own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning with stumbling into a job with the hottest man she&#39;s ever met...as his maid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between running an inn, caring for his grandmother, and trying to keep the dirty-dealing Beaumont Corporation from stealing his land, Joe Farina&#39;s plate is &lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt;. He doesn&#39;t have time for romantic entanglements--especially not with the suspiciously bad maid he just hired, no matter how attracted to her he is. But there&#39;s something different about Nina and trying to resist their chemistry begins to feel futile.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>One Week with the Marine - Allison Gatta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best friends with benefits... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avery Forrester has never been the type to settle down--not to one place, not to one job, and certainly not to one man. Still, when her long-term best friend with benefits comes home on leave with a plan--including marriage and children--she realizes she&#39;ll have to do something drastic in order to keep him. Luckily, drastic is what she does best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;...isn&#39;t enough anymore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. Marine Holden Morris has never backed down from a challenge. And this time, that challenge is persuading wild child Avery Forrester, the woman he&#39;s loved his entire life, to marry him. He wants the whole deal--a wife, a family. But convincing her to become a military wife won&#39;t be easy. Then again, he knows Avery--in &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; way possible. Armed with that kind of knowledge--carnal and otherwise--how can he possibly fail?&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mina is a banshee whose greatest power lies in her siren song. She&#39;s beholden to her boss Joey, a snake-shifter who once saved her life and now employs her as a gang enforcer.

She and Joey have always trusted each other to stay alive, but now she&#39;s not sure what to believe.

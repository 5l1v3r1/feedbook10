His professional life isnt all Billy has to worry about. His ex-girlfriend suddenly steps back into his life. Not only is it difficult for Billy to uncover her true intentions in regards to their relationship, but she also reveals that she has a child  and that the child is actually Billys son. Is his exs story true? How will Billy deal with a new child, a new court case, and the lingering grief of his loss?

Theres an old, familiar detective who will guide Billy through the mucky waters of criminal law. There are so many people who help Billy, but in a way, he is there to help them, too, as all earthly creatures must struggle to make sense life." />

          &lt;strong&gt;Wish upon a Wedding…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Five surprising trips to the altar!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IT STARTED AT A WEDDING… Kate Hardy&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claire Stewart thinks her day can&#39;t get any worse—but she&#39;s wrong! As if losing her best friend&#39;s wedding dress isn&#39;t enough, she&#39;s now faced with the ultra-handsome, ultra-successful brother of the bride, Sean Farrell… Oh, and she&#39;s had a crush on him for years!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FROM EX TO ETERNITY Kat Cantrell&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two years after waiting at the altar for Keith Mitchell, Cara isn&#39;t ready to see him again, much less work with him on her bridal fashion show! For his part, now that he knows the truth, and they&#39;re spending long days together, he wants her back. Will Cara use their passion to gain the ultimate revenge?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HIS PERFECT BRIDE? Louisa Heaton&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Oliver James knows exactly what his ‘perfect bride’ should be like—and vibrant, unconventional Lula Chance is the total opposite! Lula&#39;s determined not to be distracted by brooding bachelor Oliver…no matter how gorgeous he is. But it&#39;s only a matter of time before they give into the inevitable…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EXPECTING THE EARL’S BABY Jessica Gilmore&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was the most incredible night of her life, but Daisy Huntingdon-Cross never expected to see her Valentine fling again. Except six weeks later Daisy&#39;s world is turned upside down—she&#39;s pregnant! She needs to tell the father… Yet the man she knew as ‘Seb’ has a few revelations of his own and he’s determined to claim his heir…starting with a wedding!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FROM FAKE TO FOREVER Kat Cantrell&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After one night of tequila and sex, their impromptu Vegas wedding shouldn&#39;t be valid. But Meredith Chandler-Harris has just discovered she&#39;s still tied to irresistible businessman Jason Lynhurst. She needs out of their marriage, but to become his company&#39;s new CEO, he needs her as a bride!&lt;/p&gt;

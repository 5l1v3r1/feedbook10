      <meta name="description" content="Brian Underwood had loved his neighbor, Jia, since they were children. But she was a lesbian, and he...wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;

Follow the two star-crossed lovers as they try to reconcile the changes in their lives. Because Brian&amp;#39;s a lesbian now!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I bet you&amp;#39;re a horny little tramp, aren&amp;#39;t you, Brianna? If you were still a guy, you&amp;#39;d be hard and you&amp;#39;d want to go and stroke off. But you can&amp;#39;t.&amp;rdquo; Her voice lowered, becoming deep and sultry. &amp;ldquo;Are you hot for me? Are you wet?&amp;rdquo; One hand fell casually on the inside of her thigh, sliding up the denim.&lt;br /&gt;
Brianna was shocked at her friend&amp;rsquo;s dirty talk and her nonchalant attitude. Was this what she was like when she wasn&amp;#39;t around? No wonder so many young women had fallen under her spell. &amp;ldquo;I...I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t know, okay? Jesus, Jia! I&amp;#39;ve been a woman for maybe two hours, and you think I know what it&amp;#39;s like to be...to be aroused?&amp;rdquo; she glared helplessly at her. &amp;ldquo;And what is with you? Last night the only way I would have been able to get you into my bed was with a dose of ruffies. And now you&amp;#39;re feeling me up in your car like it&amp;#39;s the most natural thing in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That was then, Bree. This is now. Last night you were a nice guy who had the unfortunate disadvantage of having a dick. Now, you&amp;#39;re a gorgeous woman with world-class boobs. And I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind seeing a lot more than I have already.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But I&amp;#39;m not going to throw you down on the floor and bang you. So I want to know what turns you on. What makes you all hot and bothered. When you were a guy, wasn&amp;#39;t there a certain body type you went for more than others? Besides me, of course.&amp;rdquo; She smirked with pride.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, yeah,&amp;rdquo; she admitted. &amp;ldquo;I always liked brunettes. Dark skin helped. Asians. Latinas. Long hair was nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But God, Jia. When I was a guy, it was easy.&amp;rdquo; She gestured at her crotch. &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;#39;s your weiner. Either it&amp;#39;s hard or not.&amp;rdquo; Her lips twitched. &amp;ldquo;No wonder so many computer geeks are guys. It&amp;#39;s a very binary world. Must be right up their alley.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jia snickered. &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;#39;s true.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But we can&amp;#39;t send you out into public without knowing the basics. Otherwise you&amp;#39;ll have your signals crossed and some randy lesbo will take advantage of you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She pulled neatly into a parking space across from Brianna&amp;#39;s apartment. She looked down at her hands, which were clenched tightly on the steering wheel. &amp;ldquo;I could help you, if you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Help me what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Help you figure it out. How your body works. I&amp;#39;m not going to send you into the wild with no more knowledge of the female body than what you picked up having sex with your girlfriends. I mean,&amp;rdquo; she said, stuttering a little, &amp;ldquo;I know you were a good lover. Careful and considerate. I&amp;#39;ve had enough girl-talk with your girlfriends to figure that out. But following instructions from your girlfriend is a lot different than learning about your own body. And you don&amp;#39;t have the months of experimentation most kids get once they hit puberty to learn what works for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She set a hand on her arm, trying to hide the way it trembled. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ll teach you, if you want.&amp;rdquo;" />

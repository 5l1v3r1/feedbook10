  <title>The Texan&#39;s Honor-Bound Promise - Peggy Moreland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A few half-truths got him through the front door. A few more white lies had him living in her house. Texan Sam Forrester never planned on such subterfuge when he set out to honor a promise.

  <title>The Platinum Collection: A Diamond Deal: The Flaw in His Diamond / The Purest of Diamonds? / In the Brazilian&#39;s Debt (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Susan Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Priceless passion&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ultimate Italian playboy Count Roman Quisvada is not the sort of man a tender virgin would seek out for her first time, but tomboy Eva Skavanda is enjoying his attention. Perhaps Roman can help her with more than just her family’s diamond mine…? But only if she can keep her heart out of the deal!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the youngest Skavanga sister, Leila has earned her reputation as the untouched Skavanga diamond – and she’s tired of it! So, who better to fix that than sexy Spaniard Raffa Leon?! Intrigued and enticed by her request, he’ll ensure Leila gives into passion. But there are consequences for playing with fire!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lady Elizabeth Fane must beg Chico Fernandez for help. But she’s never forgiven the arrogant polo star for abandoning her. Yet, in the sultry Brazilian heat, passions flare revealing feelings Lizzie thought she’d conquered. When Chico reveals the truth behind his desertion, Lizzie realises she’s in the Brazilian’s debt!&lt;/p&gt;

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Temptation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Dempsey wants to help her sister film a video and then get out of Temptation, Ohio. Mayor Phin Tucker wants to play pool with the police chief and keep things peaceful. But when Sophie and Phin meet, they both get more than they want. Gossip, blackmail, adultery, murder, vehicular abuse of a corpse, and slightly perverse but excellent sex: all hell breaks loose in Temptation as Sophie and Phin fall deeper and deeper in trouble... and in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bet Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jennifer Crusie&#39;s novel about long shots, risk management, true love, and great shoes. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minerva Dobbs knows how to work the odds.&lt;br&gt;Calvin Morrisey always plays to win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when they face off, neither one is prepared.&lt;br&gt;Because when real life meets true love, all bets are off. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minerva Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man who asked her to dinner to win a bet, even if he is gorgeous and successful Calvin Morrisey. Cal knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs, even if she does wear great shoes and keep him on his toes. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fate has other plans, and it&#39;s not long before Min and Cal meet again. Soon they&#39;re dealing with a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a freakishly intelligent cat, Chicken Marsala, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of. Including the biggest gamble of all---true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

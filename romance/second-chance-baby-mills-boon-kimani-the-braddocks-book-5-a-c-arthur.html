  <title>Second Chance, Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Braddocks, Book 5) - A.C. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Except for one passion-filled night after his father&#39;s funeral, Ty and Felicia Braddock&#39;s marriage had been cold for years. Now Felicia was pregnant…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and unwilling to bring a child into a home with a workaholic, absentee father. She wanted a divorce, but for their child&#39;s sake Ty demanded she give their vows a second chance. But the challenging vixen Felicia had become was nothing like the sweet-tempered, predictable woman he remembered. More and more the driven financial executive found himself wanting to spend less time at the office and more time making love to his oh-so-desirable wife….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Felicia desperately wanted their marriage to work. But would their newfound desire be enough to make her husband the family man that she and their baby needed?&lt;/p&gt;

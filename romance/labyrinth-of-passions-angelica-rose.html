  <title>Labyrinth of Passions - Angelica Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The most handsome and rakish Viscount Lucas Merewether, wont even bother to
choose his own bride to beget an heir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, at all costs he wishes no emotional involvement with any woman. So he sanctions
his father, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to choose his bride to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His plan for a marriage seems boring enough considering his betroth has been cloistered
in a convent for ten years. However, hes about to find out that shes no angel. There is
nothing boring about being married to the half Spanish Lady Isabel De Carballo.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young lady has devised her own agenda after accepting the offer of marriage. The
multifarious plan calls for some desperate measures. To set herself to the task, she
must go beyond seduction, a tall order for a maid untouched by man. But she must succeed,
for shes after much more than his title and fortune, much more than the pleasures
his body pledges to generate, shes after the very thing he fears the most, the conquest
of his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Married to a rake brings about many twists. And the story is more than a simple romance.
There is intrigue, an abduction that takes Lucas into a pirates cove and even
murder. And throughout the turmoil, Isabel ignites within him a fire more intense than
anything he has ever encountered before in all his experienced years. It excites him
beyond words and the game of seduction he has entered, may soon render him lost in
the essence of her desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Coming Home to Love - Rachelle J. Christensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you remember your first love? Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had a second chance to follow your heart?When Laney Richins left Echo Ridge, New York eight years ago, she vowed she&amp;rsquo;d never return, but life had other plans. Those plans included her cute little boy and a divorce, so Laney moved back home and started over. Working in the flower shop seems like the perfect plan until Billy Redford, the man she should have married shows up. Billy Redford&amp;rsquo;s heart was broken when his high school sweetheart turned her back on him and fled Echo Ridge for the big city lights. Running into Laney in Echo Ridge now brings up past feelings he thought were long gone. She&amp;rsquo;s prettier than ever, still seems to read his mind, and despite his protests ends up on the building and decorating committee with him for the Homecoming dance. Billy knows how to build just about anything, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t sure he knows how to mend a broken heart." />

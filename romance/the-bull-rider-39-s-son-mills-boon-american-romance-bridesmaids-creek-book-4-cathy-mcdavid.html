  <title>The Bull Rider&#39;s Son (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Bridesmaids Creek, Book 4) - Cathy McDavid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;TOO CLOSE TO HOME&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassidy Beckett has a secret she&#39;s kept for six years: the identity of her son&#39;s father. She can&#39;t hide the truth much longer. The Easy Money Arena&#39;s new bull manager, Shane Westcott, also happens to be the boy&#39;s handsome uncle. But Cassidy will do anything to protect her young son, even if it means steeling her heart against Shane&#39;s nearly irresistible charm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It doesn&#39;t take Shane long to figure out two things–Cassidy&#39;s son is his nephew, and his feelings for the boy&#39;s beautiful mother go way beyond friendship. As a single dad, Shane knows how important a father is to a child. He also knows the men in Cassidy&#39;s life have let her down before. Can Shane convince Cassidy to face the truth without losing her trust…or his heart?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Naked Hunger - Desiree Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Veterinarian Sable Hunter is in Saddle Wells to take over for the retiring veterinarian. She has a reputation to build and can&#39;t afford any distractions--which is definitely what giving into the heat sparking between her and local rancher Ryan Donovan would be. Nope, no time for sexy cowboys when she has to keep focused on work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan earned his stripes one bull at a time on the rodeo circuit. Now the prize money he saved is all on the line as he breeds bucking bulls. Raising livestock in Saddle Wells isn&#39;t as exciting as the pro circuit, but the sweet new vet in town certainly livens things up. Sable claims she has no time for a relationship, so Ryan suggests they have some friends-with-benefits fun while he convinces her she doesn&#39;t have to choose between career and love. But when a costly mistake puts her career in jeopardy, Sable could lose everything, including the man she&#39;s starting to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

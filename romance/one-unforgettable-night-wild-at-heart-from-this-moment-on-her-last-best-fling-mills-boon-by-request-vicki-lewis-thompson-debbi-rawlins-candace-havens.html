  <title>One Unforgettable Night: Wild at Heart / From This Moment On / Her Last Best Fling (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Vicki Lewis Thompson, Debbi Rawlins, Candace Havens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Wild at Heart&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Domesticity can starve a man&#39;s soul, and drifter cowboy Luke Griffin believes in absolute freedom. His gig at the Last Chance Ranch will end soon, and he&#39;ll move on. But then Luke gets splashed by a green energy drink from a platform in a tree, and suddenly things get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Naomi Perkins was studying the nesting of a rare pair of bald eagles when she accidentally &quot;baptizes&quot; the delish cowboy. And when his shirt comes off…good morning, libido! But this attraction isn&#39;t just mutual—it&#39;s fierce enough to send them both tumbling into a no-strings fling.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a temporary arrangement, even if it is way more intense than anything Naomi could have imagined. But when the time comes, will she be able to let this wild cowboy go?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From This Moment On&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cowboy and lady-magnet Trace McAllister has a problem…and she&#39;s petite, with almond-shaped eyes and a body that makes his libido beg for mercy. Sure, the Sundance Dude Ranch has attracted a bevy of gorgeous townie women. But not one draws him in like sexy little Nikki Flores.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nikki isn&#39;t looking to play games with some good-lookin&#39; charmer of a cowboy. She knows better–or should. Besides, she&#39;s in Blackfoot Falls only long enough to figure out her next move. And the last thing she needs is to get tied down…or tied up!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But all &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; need is one moment–the moment when temptation takes over….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Her Last Best Fling&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reporter Macy Reynolds is the new &quot;Yankee girl&quot; in Tranquil Waters, Texas. Having recently inherited a large home and the local newspaper, she&#39;s also got a nasty case of cold shoulder from the town. Her only fan is the enormous dog she&#39;s just adopted–a dog who is about to land Macy into some deep (and incredibly hot) marine waters….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was in red high heels and soaked to the skin, trying to shove the reluctant Great Dane into her car. And that was all it took for Lieutenant Blake Michaels to realise just how badly he wanted Macy. Still haunted by his past–and she by hers–neither of them is looking for anything serious. But there&#39;s something demanding and carnal in play. The only way to satisfy it? One hot little fling…&lt;/p&gt;

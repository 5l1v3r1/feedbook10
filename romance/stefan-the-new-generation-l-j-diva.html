  <title>Stefan: The New Generation - L.J. Diva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="*This book is incredibly long and contains the free short story of Simon*&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next instalment of L.J. Diva&amp;rsquo;s Porn Star Brothers Series continues in Stefan: The New Generation&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thirty years has passed since Carlos, Pedro and Tomas Stefan made a name for themselves in the world of porn in the late &amp;rsquo;70s. They have not only forged new careers for themselves but kept the secrets of the past hidden from their children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or so they thought&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Diana, daughter of movie producer Carlos and supermodel Vivian, has followed in her mother&amp;rsquo;s footsteps, becoming a world-famous model, but she wants more, and wishes a certain photographer didn&amp;rsquo;t infuriate her so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alena, daughter of music producers Pedro and Angelina, has followed in her parents&amp;rsquo; footsteps and is a successful world-famous singer, but she&amp;rsquo;s got her eye on a hot NYPD cop with a past she has no clue about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cabot and Antonio, a.k.a. Steele and Phoenix Stefan, twin sons of Carlos and Vivian, follow in both parents&amp;rsquo; footsteps. Both are successful models and manwhores, but Cabot gets himself into trouble that only Uncles Tomas and Roger would understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dominic and Dant&amp;eacute;, sons of Pedro and Angelina, are world-famous DJs just like their father. They are ten years apart in age, and their relationship is anything but close, until a dramatic event threatens the family forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alexis, the youngest daughter of Pedro and Angelina, is just like her sister, in looks &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; career. Their relationship is almost non-existent, until an incident finally brings them together and Alexis finds love with a man her sister once had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lives they&amp;rsquo;ve made, the businesses they&amp;rsquo;ve created, the bonds they&amp;rsquo;ve forged; the memories, loved ones, and traumas the family wish they could forget&amp;hellip;like dead lovers. What happened to them thirty years ago is now rearing its very ugly head to threaten the family, bringing to life those thought long dead, and those never known about. And until the past is finally put to rest, &lt;i&gt;none of them&lt;/i&gt; can move on&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stefan: The New Generation&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth novel in the Porn Star Brothers contemporary romance series featuring the children of Carlos, Pedro and Tomas. If you like family sagas and decades-old dirty little secrets then you&amp;rsquo;ll love the latest instalment in L.J. Diva&amp;rsquo;s page-turning series.&lt;br /&gt;

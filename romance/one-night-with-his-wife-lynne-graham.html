            &lt;em&gt;The Night that Changed Everything… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luc Sarrazin has finally found her. His beautiful wife, Star, who left with more than just his ring… Convinced that she committed fraud, he&#39;s determined to recover his money, before demanding a divorce. But his wife has two very unexpected and very identical surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now he&#39;ll make her an offer she can&#39;t refuse. He&#39;ll drop the charges against her in exchange for one last night in his bed - to quench the impossible desire he still feels for Star. But in the morning, Luc realises he cannot walk away from his children… or the consuming passion that one night wasn&#39;t enough to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;

Luc Sarrazan’s marriage to Star was hasty and brief. They separated almost immediately and Star disappeared, but Luc never filed for divorce. Eighteen months later, Luc tracks Star down fearing she’s involved in a fraud. When he discovers that Star is the mother of TWINS, he feels doubly deceived!<br /><b><i>One Night With His Wife - Lynne Graham</i></b> | An estranged husband and wife have sex one night but they do every time they meet then after. So why name it as one night with his wife. It could have been named ‘of nights and affairs with his wife’. At least the title is more erotic and makes some sense.<br /><b><i>One Night with His Wife by Lynne Graham - Goodreads</i></b> | One Night With His Wife Hardcover – September 1, 2000 by Lynne Graham (Author)<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>One Night With His Wife - Lynne Graham</a> </h3></p><hr/>

  <title>Vixens - Bertrice Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With their unbridled romance, unforgettable characters, and lush sensuality, Bertrice Small&#39;s bestsellers have captivated readers again and again. Now she concludes her thrilling Skye&#39;s Legacy series with the story of three cousins, all great-great granddaughters of the fabled Skye O&#39;Malley. Spirited beauties whose pride, passions, and scandalous choices brand them.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Vixens  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Fancy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Surrounded by mystery and scandal, the widowed Fancy Devers, Fortune and Kieran&#39;s last child, arrives in England only to catch the roving eye of King Charles II--who makes the raven-haired, turquoise-eyed beauty one of his many lovers. But when their fiery romance settles into a comfortable friendship, the king is determined to find his glamorous mistress a husband--no matter her strenuous objections.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Siren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The lovely Lady Diana Leslie, Patrick and Flanna&#39;s daughter, has been nicknamed &quot;Siren&quot; by the gentlemen of the court. Her exquisite beauty, her generous nature, her charming manners, make it difficult for even her rivals to speak ill of her. But when Diana&#39;s heart is engaged by identical twin brothers, she finds herself torn. Choosing is impossible--yet choose she must.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Cyn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Lady Cynara Stuart is the not-so-royal Stuart&#39;s youngest daughter. Despite her family&#39;s insistence that she settle down, Cyn wants no man unless he can be her plaything. Then she meets the earl of Summersfield, a dangerous man every bit as adept at the game of love as she is. Only one can win at this game. And neither Cyn nor Harry Summers is a good loser.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Naughty. Notorious. Compelling. These three heroines prove that bad girls not only finish first, they lead the way to undeniable desire.  .  ." />

  <title>Kneeling For Big Brother - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delia has two men on her mind who need help. Her brother Greg, home from the Army, has terrible nightmares that only Delia can calm: By using her mouth, even though he never actually wakes up. She also has an old friend, Connor, who needs encouragement in his dealings with women because he&amp;#39;s poorly endowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Greg leaned over and clicked the dial on the old air conditioner to high, while eyeing Delia. His sister was so incredibly pretty, so tall with the body of a professional bikini model, that he sometimes could hardly believe that she was the same girl he remembered. Always a pretty child, her body had developed while he was away in the Army. Now she was a grown woman and more womanly than most.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The overly warm single-wide living room and its loud, old air conditioner offered no romantic atmosphere at all. They had played and argued in this room as kids. The carpet was old and worn. It was as boring a place for love-making as anywhere he could imagine. Even the Army storerooms and barracks where he had sometimes stolen a few moments to screw women had a certain oddball excitement. This was just home, nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delia stepped forward and took his burgundy shirt from his hand. She draped it neatly on the edge of the couch. Then she unbuckled his belt, unfastened the button at his waist, and watched his dockers drop to his ankles to reveal his snug gray briefs. She giggled at how fast his pants fell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her light-hearted laugh of delight reminded him of earlier years and that made him feel good. He bent down to take off his shoes, but she stopped him with a palm on his chest as she crouched down. She knelt and untied his shoes, then took them off, followed by his socks. Then she pulled his feet out of the pant legs in turn." />

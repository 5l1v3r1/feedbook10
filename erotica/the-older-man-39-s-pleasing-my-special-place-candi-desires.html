  <title>The Older Man&#39;s Pleasing My Special Place - Candi Desires</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She can&amp;#39;t think clearly. All she can think about is how he&amp;#39;s about to become her first.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;This older man wants to take Caitlin, a younger woman, for her first time. What he doesn&amp;#39;t know is that she wants it just as much as he does, and she wants to do it hard and without protection!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Betcha can&amp;#39;t read just one!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Wow Cooper, you didn&amp;#39;t have to get me so many presents!&amp;quot; Caitlin says to her buddy. She&amp;#39;s just turned 18 years old today.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Well, hold onto your hats, because there&amp;#39;s one more!&amp;quot; Cooper announces, pulling one last present out from under the dining table.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin laughs with joy as he places it among the others on the table.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You know, it&amp;#39;s a bit of a relief,&amp;quot; Caitlin says to her buddy. &amp;quot;I can finally do all those adult things that everybody else gets to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What sorts of adult things do you want to do?&amp;quot; Cooper asks, but Caitlin doesn&amp;#39;t reply. Instead she only gives him a smile that says more than words ever could.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin&amp;#39;s a virgin, which means she&amp;#39;s never even kissed another guy before. But she&amp;#39;s had dreams. Dreams that involve her letting a man enter her, fill up her body with his big tool, and bang her until she comes over and over from it. And just before she wakes up, with her hand down in the fork of her crotch rubbing her aching clit like mad, she looks in this dream man&amp;#39;s face and it always turns out to be her buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Every time.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;All Cooper has been able to think about all day is Caitlin. It&amp;#39;s hot out and all the blood is running down to his groin, making it hard more often than not. Besides that, Caitlin&amp;#39;s just turned 18 and it&amp;#39;s almost like this age flicked a switch on inside of her. She&amp;#39;s become more sexual, more flirty, but more shy as well. The forbidden fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, here,&amp;quot; Cooper says. &amp;quot;You need this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He picks up a Birthday Girl pin from the table and comes up to his friend&amp;#39;s daughter, pinning the novelty item to the front of her shirt. She watches him as he does this, his hands precariously close to her breasts. When he&amp;#39;s done they both look down at it, and then up into each other&amp;#39;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; she says without taking her eyes away. Cooper smiles.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It was my pleasure,&amp;quot; he says to her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin looks at her buddy. He just looks so good ... are these normal feelings that she&amp;#39;s having? Do other girls get like this when they&amp;#39;re around their own buddy?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s anything Caitlin can help. She just feels how she feels, like how you get nervous before giving a big speech. Well she feels nervous now too, but it&amp;#39;s a different kind of nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same kind of nervous when she first started imagining boys.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Urgh,&amp;quot; Cooper says, bending his head to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What is it, Cooper?&amp;quot; Caitlin asks her buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ve just been a bit tense lately,&amp;quot; he says, rubbing the back of his neck. And to his surprise Caitlin gives him a devilish smile.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Is there anything I can do to ... help relieve that tension?&amp;quot; she asks. Cooper&amp;#39;s heart skips a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I can think of a few things.&amp;quot;" />

~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without asking, Lucas drained off his whisky and walked to the sideboard to pour himself another. He turned and looked at me. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine here. Just don&amp;rsquo;t be too long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt a quiver of arousal at the sound of his voice. There was an edge to his tone. Lucas was smiling yet something untamed lurked behind his eyes. Despite his smiling demeanour, I got a glimpse of the beast behind the urbane mask. The impression left me with the distinct sense Lucas hadn&amp;rsquo;t come over solely to pick up some papers. It was in the predatory look. His last sentence had been an instruction. He was telling me what to do and I began to suspect the documents were a ruse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; I said, meek, demure, and a little confused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A shiver ran through me when he murmured, &amp;ldquo;Good girl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I left him with his whisky, excitement and dread coiling inside me." />

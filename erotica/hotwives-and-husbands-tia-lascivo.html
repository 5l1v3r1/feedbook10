  <title>Hotwives and Husbands - Tia Lascivo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of six stories about sexy hotwives and the husbands who love them.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Wendy Jacobs felt so wild and free. Desired. Feminine.
She got out of the car and looked at the front of the house. Saw a sliver of light through a chink in the drapes.
“He’s still up,” said Wendy to the man in the car.
“Problem?” he asked.
Wendy snickered, the sound dark and foul while she shook her head.
“God no,” she replied. “You get on. It’ll be fine.”
The man pulled a face, lips pursed.
Dubious, he said, “You sure?”
She nodded. “Absolutely.”
He shrugged, threw the selector into drive.
Wendy closed the door and watched the tail lights wink as he tapped the brakes at the corner. Then he was gone.
“Where have you been?” her husband accused when she got inside the house.
“Out,” said Wendy as Robert took a glance at his watch.
“It’s two-thirty,” he said. “Where the hell have you been until now? How did you get home?”
“Robert,” she said, tone brooking no argument. “Go and get me a drink.”
He looked at his wife, the refusal right there behind his teeth. Wendy could see it jammed there, knowing he wouldn’t have the guts to tell her to get lost.
Wendy knew she’d won when Robert’s mouth snapped shut and he all but scuttled away to comply with her wants." />

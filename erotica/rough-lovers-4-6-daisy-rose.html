  <title>Rough Lovers 4 - 6 - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blue-black bruises are just the perfect accessories for the innocent young submissive women in this bundle. Jane falls for a man too old for her, Tess surrenders to an Alpha who is vastly more experienced, and Olivia... well, Olivia should have read the small print before signing the contract allowing a stranger to ruin her completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Simulated,&amp;quot; he corrected. &amp;quot;It will be entirely consensual and you will be handsomely paid.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; I blurted out, almost accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed. It was a deep, warm sound that was even more shocking because of how nice it sounded compared to the topic at hand. I stared at him incredulously the entire time. When he was finally over his amusement, he said, &amp;quot;Because I can.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It sent shivers down my spine, how easy his answer came to him, how simple he made it sound. He wanted to do it because he could. &amp;quot;Why not- why not hire someone?&amp;quot; I asked even though the answer came to me straight away. Peter approached me because it was obvious how desperate for cash I was. He didn&amp;#39;t want an act, he wanted it to seem real.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I prefer inexperienced submissives,&amp;quot; he said with a kind smile that was antithetical to the words he was saying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stared at the papers in my hand, uncertainty brewing heavily in my mind. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know if I can- I mean, I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can do this. I&amp;#39;ve never done anything like this before and-&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m a virgin, I almost blurted out, but I kept that to myself. There was that practical part of my brain that told me it was only for one night. By this time tomorrow, it was going to be a distant memory and I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about whether I could afford tuition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry about acting,&amp;quot; he said, almost kindly. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re going to be a little scared, a little naive, and you&amp;#39;re going to struggle because you don&amp;#39;t know anything and I&amp;#39;m not going to be gentle.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I swallowed the lump in my throat and crossed my legs. I clenched my hands together so he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to tell how strongly I was trembling. I wanted to correct him. I was much more than a little scared and a lot more than a little naive. I have never had sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course, you could always have a safeword if you want to feel safer.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Safe word?&amp;quot; I asked. There was a dotted line at the bottom for me to write it. I had been thinking about that ever since I read about it. It was a safety net that I realized I could take solace in. All the information I read had emphasized the importance of a safeword, especially when &amp;#39;playing&amp;#39; with a new partner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Having a safeword would allow you stop whatever it is that is going on,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;However... if you choose to go without one, I&amp;#39;ll double the money.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stared at him. &amp;quot;Double?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All of it,&amp;quot; he nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a lot of money,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;" />

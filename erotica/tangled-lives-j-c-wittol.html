When they meet DeShawn, a handsome black man recovering from a military injury, John proposes an erotic solution that thrills his sexy Queen of Spades wife. What follows is an exciting ride of love, unbridled lust, and uncontrollable interracial attraction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a perfect day at the beach. The blue/green water contrasted nicely against the white sand beaches. The sound of the surf filled the air, and it provided the perfect accompaniment to their drinks. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before they were talking like old friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m hot, and the water looks great. Who&amp;rsquo;s with me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Becca had picked a chair in between the guys, and was on her third margarita. She finished the potent beverage with a flourish, stood, and removed the wrap around her waist. Her micro-bikini left little to the imagination, and almost every male face on the beach turned in her direction. Based on DeShawn&amp;rsquo;s expression, it was clear he also approved of her bikini.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Quit staring, put your tongues back in your mouths, and let&amp;rsquo;s go!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His wife walked through the sand, her hips swaying, and John&amp;rsquo;s mouth suddenly went dry. Becca worked out regularly, and the Brazilian-cut bikini did little to cover her toned assets. DeShawn followed her, but John decided to use the restroom. When he returned, Becca and DeShawn were playing around in the surf and splashing each other. His wife&amp;rsquo;s eyes were devouring DeShawn, and she seemed to fall against him with an erotic regularity. Instead of joining them, though, he ordered another drink and returned to his lounge chair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Becca stumbled in the surf, cried out, and started to fall. DeShawn surged through the water, and managed to catch her before she went under the waves. His arms slid under her, and he carried her out of the water. She slid her arm around DeShawn&amp;rsquo;s neck, and leaned her head against his chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John took a long sip of his beer, and admitted they looked amazing together. The contrast in their skin tones was beautiful. And strangely&amp;hellip;erotic. He glanced around, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help noticing several women seated near them watched DeShawn and Becca with envious eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shifted on the lounge chair, and embarrassment flooded through him when he realized he was hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What the&amp;hellip;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DeShawn lowered Becca carefully onto her chair, and his mouth dropped open. John smiled, because he knew DeShawn had just seen how transparent Becca&amp;rsquo;s suit got when it was wet. She&amp;rsquo;d purchased the suit just for this vacation, and it was made of a light material that turned sheer when it got wet. DeShawn&amp;rsquo;s eyes were also locked on her midsection, specifically the spade tattoo on her hip, and recognition flashed in his eyes. His gaze eventually left the tattoo, traveled up her body, and finally their eyes met. An inviting smile curved her lips. It was a sexy smile that clearly communicated she&amp;rsquo;d seen him admiring her tattoo, her body, and she was happy to have his attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You rescued me, and that makes you my hero.&amp;rdquo; She kissed him. &amp;ldquo;Consider that a thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re welcome. Anytime, anytime at all.&amp;rdquo;" />

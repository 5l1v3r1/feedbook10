      <meta name="description" content="Trey Colton, Jace Callahan and Garrett &quot;G.&quot; Blake were accustomed to getting everything they wanted-in business and in pleasure.   Jace: I had a successful business. Now I wanted more. The woman that fueled my desires. The woman that had stolen my heart. So how, when everything felt so right, could a problem resurface and send our lives spinning out of control? I&#39;d made a promise to keep her safe and I always kept my promises. But the past has a way of coming back to haunt you. A past that now threatened to destroy our future.   Lexi: My life had been filled with pain and heartache and only my best friend knew the depths of that pain-until now.  Now, the one person I never expected had turned my life upside down.  Jace had stolen my breath, stopped my heart and taken my body to places I didn&#39;t know existed. But Jace had told me-no barriers, no secrets. I needed to tell him. I needed to know he wouldn&#39;t walk away.  That the secret I was hiding wouldn&#39;t destroy us both." />

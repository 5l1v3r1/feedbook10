  <title>Neighbors - G. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She was beautiful and sexy; everything I could ever want. The problem was she was my best friend&amp;#39;s mother and my family&amp;#39;s next door neighbor. We should never have gotten together but we did. We never intended it to happen but it did. Sometimes life just happens and sometimes it just goes wild.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I will tell you what, come on over by the pool in my yard and you can tell your other mother all about it. You can talk to me.&amp;rdquo; She said as she reached out for me to take her hand as though I was a child. I took her hand and she led me to her yard and she sat down on Chaise lounge and motioned for me to sit in the deck chair right next to her. I sat down and we started to talk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I told her almost verbatim what the conversation consisted of and how hurt I felt&amp;hellip;I told her I felt my whole world had collapsed and that it was my fault. We talked freely and easily and she listened intently and asked a couple of questions to clarify things about how I felt and what had happened. She only nodded her understanding when I answered her. She was completely non-judgmental about it. When it was all said and done I felt better and told her I thought I should go home. She nodded and got up as I did. She gave me a hug to comfort me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had hugged me countless times before, but this time holding that hot, mostly naked, body in my arms awakened something in me. I could feel her breasts pushing against my chest. I could hear her breathing in my ear. When she started to break the hug I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to let go. Our bodies parted a little bit and when I didn&amp;rsquo;t release her she looked at me questioningly. I pulled her back to me, and kissed her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I kissed her as a man kisses a woman he wants. She resisted at first, pushing away from me, and then she melted into me started kissing back. She kissed as though a hungry beast inside her had been released. We kept it up and I started nuzzling her neck and kissing it and she cocked her head back to let me have all of it freely. I could hear her breathing grow faster and then more ragged in arousal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I put my hand on her left breast and gave it a squeeze and she let out a soft moan of approval. I kept it up and her breathing in my ear, as we kissed and held each other, grew more ragged still. I undid the back strap on her bikini and ran my hand back around to squeeze her bare breast. She let me squeeze it for a moment. Her nipples were already erect, but they grew harder still. Her breasts were firm and filled my hand and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I began to pinch her nipple between my index finger and my thumb. She responded with a soft appreciative moan and put her hand down the top of my speedo and started to stroke my cock which was very hard and demanding attention. Soon she had it free of my swimsuit and was stroking it urgently while I kissed her&amp;hellip; Her kisses were hot and passionate. I ran my hand down her stomach and into her bikini bottom to play with her pussy&amp;hellip;.when she suddenly pushed me backwards and held me at arm&amp;rsquo;s length with one hand while holding her bikini top in place with the other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; she panted heavily. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t. Please go home.&amp;rdquo; She had a pained look on her face like she had just made the hardest decision of her life. She looked almost desperate." />

  <title>Owned Mind &amp; Body - Daniel Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lindsay&amp;#39;s big brother comes home from university, the siblings look forward to a reunion they&amp;#39;d both spent months sexting each about. Although Pierce is cautious at first, Lindsay quickly convinces her brother her true purpose is to be his sex slave. Soon Pierce eagerly sexually owns his sister mind, body and soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pierce took a quick shower, texting Lindsay, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m home&amp;quot; and half expecting her to sneak into the bathroom while he washed up. He felt a little foolish when she not only didn&amp;#39;t join him, but didn&amp;#39;t text back at all. Perhaps she had grown timid. Perhaps nothing was going to happen after all. He was an adult; an experienced university graduate. Lindsay was still in high school, young and innocent. If she had told Pierce the truth, she&amp;#39;d never even had a boyfriend before. Who was he to push his perversion on her? It was a fantasy. Perhaps it was best it remained that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After dressing again in fresh clothes, Pierce made his way toward the kitchen. He found his mother hurriedly working on half a dozen dishes for his homecoming dinner and, not wanting to be in the way, left her to her talents. He thought about sneaking upstairs to find Lindsay, and drew up short as he entered the living room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There she was, sitting on the couch. She&amp;#39;d blossomed incredibly during those four years away, far more beautiful than any of the photos she&amp;#39;d sent to him while he was away. Her hair was long and shiny, her skin clear and pale, her eyes bright with heavy lids. She was slim and fit from running, and beginning to fill out her teenaged curves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Linds,&amp;quot; Pierce gasped, surprised to see her sitting there. She wore her school uniform, like she&amp;#39;d once promised she would, but it was her eyes that transfixed him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes were piercing as she stared at him as he fumbled into sitting down in the arm chair across from her. He pulled out his phone as a lifeline, expecting to have a reply text from her finally, telling him what they were doing, but there was no message.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He noticed suddenly that Lindsay&amp;#39;s breath was coming fast, but she held herself in such a way that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be noticed. As his mother worked on dinner in the kitchen only a short hall away, Lindsay spread her legs so her short, dark school skirt fell down between them. Then, without taking her eyes off her brother&amp;#39;s, she inched the skirt up her thighs, her breath coming faster as she revealed that secret spot between her legs to Pierce." />

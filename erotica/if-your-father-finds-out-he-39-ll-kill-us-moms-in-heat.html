  <title>If Your Father Finds Out, He&#39;ll Kill Us! - Moms In Heat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wanted my son. Badly. I needed him so much my lady parts ached. I was getting to that age where I would no longer be able to have a baby. But I wanted one last one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My husband, Don, was always on the road. He was never home when I really needed him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I needed him now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon learning of my son&amp;rsquo;s predicament with his wife, however, I alone had the answer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would carry their baby for them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll admit it. I&amp;#39;m a sex-starved housewife. A mother of three grown adults and one no-so-grown husband (I keed). Don - the husband in question - travels a lot. And I mean a LOT. Business trips up the ass. No, honey, I don&amp;#39;t want to spend another week in some shitty hotel in the middle of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Been there, done that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I sit at home all day all alone. Just me and my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh sure, I volunteer at the local food pantry, do odd jobs, take brisk walks around town. But none of that scratches my...itch - if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;#39;ve found that as I&amp;#39;ve crossed that magical &amp;quot;40&amp;quot; threshold, I&amp;#39;ve grown a HELL of a lot more sexual. I mean every other thought is about banging someone (that&amp;#39;s usually not my husband, sad to say).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, when my 20-year-old hot, hunky (God what kind of MOTHER had I become?) son called and said he wanted to come over and visit, I was over the moon. It had been awhile since I&amp;#39;d seen the handsome hunk and I was looking forward to it. Said he wanted to take me out to a nice restaurant for a treat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He gave me an hour to put on my best dress and get all dolled up. This was wholly unexpected. Danny had never done anything like this before. He&amp;#39;d always been a nice boy, but never this nice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the course of the next couple hours, Danny wined and dined me, taking me out to THE fanciest restaurant in town. Plus dancing and a movie afterwords. Several people commented that we made a cute couple.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If they only knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found out that he just got a promotion and a BIG pay raise and wanted to celebrate it with me. When he said that, my panties literally flooded with my motherly juices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was looking exceptionally HOT tonight and by the time he dropped me off at my door I was more than a bit tipsy and if he hadn&amp;#39;t been my son I would&amp;#39;ve tore into his pants right then and there on the porch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, see you later, ma!&amp;quot; He called out and started to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. Come in. Stay for a bit. I&amp;#39;ll brew us some coffee.&amp;quot; I was so nervous my knees were literally shaking. &amp;quot;Please?&amp;quot; Was I really begging my son? What kind of sex-crazed monstress had I become?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He thought about it for a moment, checked his watch, then nodded. &amp;quot;Christine isn&amp;#39;t expecting me back for another hour or so. Sure, why not?&amp;quot;" />

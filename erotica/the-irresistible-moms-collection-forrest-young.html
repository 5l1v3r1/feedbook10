  <title>The Irresistible Moms Collection - Forrest Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It may have crossed your mind, but would you ever cross the line?
Seductive dreams drive one young man to obsessive turmoil… Hidden desires begin to involuntarily surface in another, testing the limits of his free and open lifestyle… Forbidden fantasies compel another to voyeuristic tendencies that break every acceptable boundary!
Indulge yourself in three titillating tales of those who not only cross the line, but totally shatter it. This collection of three full-length stories explores generational taboos in ways that are sure to arouse your senses and set your imagination soaring with page after page of shocking, yet illicitly thrilling scenarios!
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
When Rebecca called to let me know that some beauty products she’d ordered for me had arrived, I agreed to pick them up on the way home from work. And I fretted, all afternoon, whether I’d feel awkward around her.
I needn’t have worried. Rebecca didn’t seem to have any clue about what had transpired between Derrick and me a few nights ago. In fact, she was in a very good mood. I made an effort to hide my own feelings, so she wouldn’t suspect how I was enjoying the devilish thrill of keeping such an erotic, forbidden secret from her.
When Derrick came home, and saw us sitting on the couch together, his lips curved into a welcoming smile that included, to my perceptive eyes, a knowing little grin. The rest of my worries vanished. I hadn’t scarred him; he’d enjoyed the encounter just as much as I had, and was perfectly okay with how things had played out.
“Hi, Aunt Stacy,” he exclaimed, and cheerfully kissed the top of my head as he walked by.
“Hi, sweetie,” I replied, trying to sound casually nonchalant.
Rebecca lifted an eyebrow. I quickly diverted her by asking, “So are things going okay now?”
Her emphatic nod reassured me. “Oh, he’s been in an amazingly good mood the last few days!” Then she broached the question I’d hoped to avoid: “I take it the talk you had with him the other night went pretty well?”
“Yeah, we had a really nice time. He can still pack away a pizza like no one’s business!” Then, because she was obviously bursting with curiosity, I carefully added, “He’s been worried about a girl he’s been seeing. I didn’t press him for details…kids his age are nerve endings all over, you know? But using me as a sounding board seemed to help.”
She seemed satisfied with that, and easily moved on to another topic.
Derrick came downstairs just as I was getting ready to leave. When I heard him moving around in the kitchen, I decided to risk a few moments alone with him. “You doing okay?” I softly urged, after making sure my sister was still busily packing up our beauty supplies in the living room.
He nodded emphatically. “Things are going great. Our visit the other night really helped.”
“I’m glad.” I couldn’t help grinning back at him. “I really enjoyed it, too. No more, ah, crazy thoughts?”
He glanced cautiously toward the open doorway, then lifted one broad shoulder in a rueful shrug. “Well, the thoughts are still there. But they’re not driving me crazy anymore.”
That was a relief. “I’m glad to hear it. But if you ever need to, um, talk some more, you’ll let me know?”
Impish delight lit his eyes. “You know I will.” Cheerfully he picked up his sandwich, kissed me on the forehead—lingering just a few seconds longer than was strictly proper—and then headed back upstairs. The sweet gesture warmed me even as I felt hot tingles coil through my belly.
I felt really good about myself as I drove home. But even though I was ridiculously proud of knowing that Derrick was doing better, even if the means had been extremely unconventional, I was equally disappointed that—despite his assurance in the kitchen—the experience probably would not be repeated. I’d discovered a new side to myself that was both exciting and a little disturbing. Could I ever find something else that would arouse me that intensely again?" />

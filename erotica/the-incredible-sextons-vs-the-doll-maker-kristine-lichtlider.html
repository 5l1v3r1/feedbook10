  <title>The Incredible Sextons vs the Doll Maker - Kristine Lichtlider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Incredible Sextons, America&amp;#39;s favorite super family, are into some kinky sex. Whether getting it on with each other or their bound and gagged rubber maid Lena Payne, they still find time for super heroic hijinks. When they run afoul of a villain obsessed with abducting women and turning them into living dolls, the Sextons must face their greatest challenge yet, all while new foes gain power on the sidelines...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What the fuck?&amp;rdquo; Tina said in a voice thick with sleep. She tried to rear up and look over her shoulder, but Thad grabbed her by the back of the neck and forced her face back into the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re in big trouble, young lady,&amp;rdquo; he said sternly. &amp;ldquo;How could you leave your mother bound and gagged all night? She&amp;#39;s almost forty, her joints can&amp;#39;t take that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah cast a withering look at Thad, which he completely missed, and forced Tina&amp;#39;s elbows together. She was extra vehement with her ropework, pulling the knots so tight Tina&amp;#39;s flesh bubbled up around the silken coils. Tina struggled, feet kicking as Thad held her face down in the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She has to breathe, Thad,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said as she forced Tina to bend her elbows. She took the girl&amp;#39;s wrists and bound them to her waist with a length of rope around her midsection. Tina&amp;#39;s hands were now bound to her own back, and completely useless for any type of resistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Eventually,&amp;rdquo; Thaddeus said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;d rather not hear her excuses right now. Hand me the pear gag from the duffel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Little busy, Thad,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said as she turned around to face Tina&amp;#39;s feet. She caught her daughter&amp;#39;s legs and crossed her ankles, taking them prisoner with more rope.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Very well,&amp;rdquo; he said, using his control of Electromagnetism to levitate the bag over to his hand. He finally released Tina and she reared her face out of the pillow, gasping like a landed fish.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy, please,&amp;rdquo; she said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m sorry! I was going to go back and let her loose, I just fell asleep!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There is no difference between a reason and an excuse, Tina,&amp;rdquo; Thaddeus said harshly. &amp;ldquo;I am very disappointed in your lack of responsibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He held the metal pear gag in front of her face, and she grimaced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh shit,&amp;rdquo; she said &amp;ldquo;not that thing!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pear gag was particularly nasty. It consisted of a metal teardrop shape connected to a short length of chain. A screw set into the base would allow it to expand, splitting into four separate bars to&amp;mdash;painfully&amp;mdash;fill its victim&amp;#39;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s only what you deserve, young lady,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said sternly. She looped rope around Tina&amp;#39;s knees and tied it viciously tight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ow!&amp;rdquo; Tina said. &amp;ldquo;That hurts!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So do my knees,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said. &amp;ldquo;Maybe after this, you&amp;#39;ll remember not to leave people just tied up all night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We do it to Lena all the time,&amp;rdquo; Tina protested.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Lena&amp;#39;s suit has a distress monitor, in case she stops breathing or is in great pain,&amp;rdquo; Thaddeus said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s not the same thing, Tina. Now open your mouth.&amp;rdquo;" />

  <title>Family Fun - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Sophie Morgan hated pajamas. On the few occasions when one of her schoolmates had spent the night with her, she wore a sheer gown that barely covered the chestnut triangle which her Father had repeatedly warned her was the gateway to hell. She found it difficult to believe that the sensitive little opening between her thighs was evil, no matter what others might say about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Just before she had come upstairs, Tom had told her that he would drop in and kiss her goodnight, a habit they had both enjoyed until their Mother&amp;rsquo;s death. After that, their Father had sternly forbidden either of them to enter the other&amp;rsquo;s bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sophie stretched luxuriously, the sheet sliding against the points of her small breasts, making them stiffen. It was different now, she reminded herself happily. Tom was the boss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He could do anything he wished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She heard her brother ascend the stairway and enter Carol&amp;rsquo;s room, but she thought nothing of it. They would have things to discuss concerning the big farm. When they were finished, Tom would come in to deliver that promised kiss, and she could go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drowsiness pulled her eyelids down, and she had no idea how much time had elapsed when the opening of her door made her sit straight up in the bed, the sheet sliding down to her waist, baring the pert-nippled cones of her firm young breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a long instant during which she felt Tom&amp;rsquo;s hot eyes on her naked torso. Then, with a little gasp, she tugged the sheet up to cover herself, clutching it with both hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry,&amp;rdquo; she apologized blinking at her brother&amp;rsquo;s faint smile. She had never before seen that particular expression. &amp;ldquo;I got so sleepy, I guess I just dozed off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He closed the door, one hand extending to the wall switch beside it. &amp;ldquo;You look uncomfortable,&amp;rdquo; he murmured, &amp;ldquo;holding that silly sheet. I&amp;rsquo;ll cut the light, and you won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the sound of a soft click, darkness enveloped the room, leaving only the faint light from the window to outline his figure as he moved toward the bed. Sophie&amp;rsquo;s fingers released the sheet, her arms reaching out to welcome him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He sat down on the side of the bed, turning slightly to slip his arms about her naked waist. Gently, his fingers caressing the soft warmth of her skin, he pulled her against his chest. Her arms tightened about his neck, and she lifted her lips for his kiss. Eyes closed, she waited.&lt;br /&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Family Fun - Timothy Spears</i></b> | Family Fun. By Timothy Spears. ... Timothy Spears does not advocate sex as the prime focus of life; and while sexual privacy is very important, many adults harbor fears about themselves and their sexual behavior that could be erased if they were more aware of other people's behavior.<br /><b><i>Smashwords – Family Fun – a book by Timothy Spears</i></b> | However, as he does with his father and himself, Timothy Spears writes about much more than just the football careers of the three Spears men. For each man, their family bonds and their academics are just as important and these passages will bring out the most emotional response from a reader. This is best illustrated when each of them is in college. For Timothy, his reflections on his life on campus but away from football is both humorous and touching.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Spirals: A Family's Education in Football ...</i></b> | While Spears chose an academic life after college, he understood later, with the decline of his parents, how much football stayed with him and shaped his family’s history. With a voice that is part memoirist, part scholar, part athlete, as well as father and son, Spears discerns how football is embedded in our culture and came to be the fabric and common language of his family.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Family Fun - Timothy Spears</a> </h3></p><hr/>

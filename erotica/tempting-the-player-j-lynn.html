  <title>Tempting the Player - J. Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tempting the Player (A Gamble Brothers Novel) by J. Lynn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chad Gamble, all-star pitcher for the Nationals, is one of the best players on--and off--the field. And right now, the notorious bad boy wants Bridget Rodgers. But with her lush curves and snappy comebacks, the feisty redhead is the kind of woman a man wants to settle down with...and that&#39;s the last thing Chad needs. When the paparazzi catch them in a compromising position, Chad&#39;s manager issues an ultimatum: clean up his act or kiss his multi-million dollar contract goodbye. To save his career, his meddling publicist says he&#39;ll have to convince everyone Bridget isn&#39;t just his flavor of the week, but his girlfriend. Being blackmailed into a fake relationship with Chad Gamble isn&#39;t easy, especially when the sizzling physical attraction between them is undeniable. With a month to go on their arranged pretense, it&#39;s going to take every ounce of willpower they have not to fall into bed together...or in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

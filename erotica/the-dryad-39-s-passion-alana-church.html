  <title>The Dryad&#39;s Passion - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finian is an apprentice to his grandfather, High Druid of all Britain. Eilonwy is the daughter of the queen of the dryads. When the high druid died, their world was thrown into tumult. For generations the druids had merged their bloodlines with the spirits of stone, sea, and sky, the better to bridge the gaps between their worlds.&lt;br /&gt;
But now a new age is dawning. Rome, with its mighty military and its new gods, thinks little of the tribes of Britain. If Finian and Eilonwy are to weather the storm, they will have to learn to work together, despite their differences. And what role will Aurelia, half-blood daughter of the governor of Corinium, play in our tale? She has seen the future through the gift of her mother&amp;#39;s people, but will she have the strength to embrace her fate?&lt;br /&gt;
Old foes become new allies, and desire erupts in the most unlikely of places. Because, despite all they can do, Eilonwy, Finian, and Aurelia are all caught in the web of&amp;hellip;&lt;i&gt;The Dryad&amp;#39;s Passion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What,&amp;rdquo; she asked, &amp;ldquo;was that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Finian grinned up at her like a fool, his face full of a joy that echoed her own. &amp;ldquo;Humans call it an orgasm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And human women&amp;hellip;have these&amp;hellip;orgasms&amp;hellip;often?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged, seemingly embarrassed, and sat back on his heels, the movement bringing more of his magnificent body into view. She eyed it with unabashed hunger. &amp;ldquo;I think they can. I don&amp;#39;t know if they do. The woman who&amp;hellip;who was my first lover&amp;hellip;taught me how to please her. I am very happy that what works for women works for dryads as well, Eilonwy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She was suddenly consumed by a blazing fire of jealous fury. Another woman had dared to lie with her beloved? Had she taken his seed within her? Born his child?&lt;br /&gt;
She forced the anger away, another thought striking her. &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;hellip;can men have this orgasm, as well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
A lopsided smile pulled his mouth into an attractive curve. &amp;ldquo;Oh, yes. We can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And how is it done?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He made a cautious gesture towards his shaft, which was still rising proudly from its nest of pubic hair at his groin. &amp;ldquo;With your hands. Or your mouth.&amp;rdquo; She felt her eyes widen in surprise. That in her mouth? She fought back a giggle. &lt;i&gt;Of course, a few moments ago, you would never have thought Finian would put his mouth where he did. And look how pleasantly that turned out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Or, if you allow it,&amp;rdquo; he continued, his face as red as his hair, &amp;ldquo;I could&amp;hellip;we could&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he stuttered to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly realizing what he was trying to say, Eilonwy lay back in the grass, letting her legs sag apart lewdly. Her eyes were drawn to his groin like a flower following the sun across the sky. His male hardness bounced in time with his heartbeat. &amp;ldquo;Inside me?&amp;rdquo; she whispered. Despite everything, she felt a tiny stab of worry. How would he&amp;hellip;gods, how would he fit?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Although quiet, his voice throbbed with need.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then come, my love,&amp;rdquo; she said, letting go of her fear and allowing her own desire fill her voice. She held out her hands to him. &amp;ldquo;Come to me.&amp;rdquo;" />

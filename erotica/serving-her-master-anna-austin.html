  <title>Serving Her Master - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Penny is a young maidservant, innocent and pure. But her innocence is soon to be corrupted...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her Master, Lord Wiltshire is a known rake and scoundrel, and when it comes to sweet little maids like Penny, he simply cannot resist his base desires...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering her quick induction to the service, Penny went to Lady Wiltshire first. The prim woman held up her glass and didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge the lowly maid as she poured her glass like she had been instructed. Next, Penny attended to the guests; the army captain who looked down the front of her corset whenever he could; the tanned man, Henry, that stroked his moustache as he lounged in his seat; and finally, James Hollington, Lord Wiltshire&amp;#39;s oldest friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Penny reached Hollington, he didn&amp;#39;t hold his glass up. She faltered for the briefest of seconds, reaching forward to pour the wine directly into his glass when the man moved his arm to snatch for the glass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything happened in slow motion. The dark liquid splashed out of the wine bottle, colliding with Hollington&amp;#39;s pearly white shirt, staining the fabric like blood would a wound. He looked down, Lady Wiltshire gasped and Penny knew she&amp;#39;d just earned herself her very first beating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of the servants had disappeared, leaving the poor young maid under the sharp gaze of the dinner guests and her master and mistress." />

  <title>Daddy&#39;s Virgin Brat - Taboo, Inc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;m nineteen and I still haven&#39;t…you know…done it with a guy.  I never imagined my first time to be with my own Daddy!  But when he sits me down and tells me I can confide in him, and that nothing we say or do will ever leave the room, well I guess the temptation was just too much for us.
Read how he deflowers me in a rough fantasy creampie encounter that&#39;ll stay with me forever.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;What&#39;s it like, Daddy?  What does it feel like?&quot;
He raised an eyebrow and took in a deep breath.  &quot;Honestly?  It feels great,&quot; he exhaled.  &quot;There&#39;s nothing quite like it.&quot;
&quot;Ohhhh, Daddy,&quot; I whined, kicking in to the floor with my heel.  &quot;Will it happen for me?&quot;
&quot;Of course it will, sweetie.  You just have to wait for the right person.&quot;
&quot;What if they never come along.&quot;
He raised his hands and dropped them.  &quot;Then I guess you&#39;ll die a virgin.&quot;
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t want that!&quot;
&quot;Well, you&#39;re kind of out of ideas.&quot;
I thought for a moment and then the craziest idea of my life popped in to my head.  I don&#39;t even know why I said it out loud.
&quot;Hey,&quot; I began and it felt too late to stop.  It totally wasn&#39;t too late but, I dunno, it kind of felt like I was going to finish this sentence and that it might not be a good idea.  &quot;You could show me the ropes, you know?&quot;" />

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amused by her description, Katherine began to giggle. &amp;ldquo;Oh Lord, Dawn, I&amp;#39;m going to miss you,&amp;rdquo; she said. She sniffled suddenly, tears winding down her cheeks. She lurched up from the table and caught Dawn in a rib-crushing hug, her face buried in her daughter&amp;#39;s hair. &amp;ldquo;I love you, Dawn,&amp;rdquo; she said, voice quavering. &amp;ldquo;Whatever happens, never forget that. I will always love you.&amp;rdquo; From the side, she felt Donny join them, his strong arms enfolding them both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She broke away, wiping her tears away with the heels of her hands. &amp;ldquo;I know I don&amp;#39;t tell you this often enough.&amp;rdquo; She swallowed around the lump in her throat and went on. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ve made some bad choices in my life. I have regrets. But if I had to do it all over, and it meant I would lose the two of you, I wouldn&amp;#39;t. You are the two best things that have ever happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love you both so much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We love you too, Momma,&amp;rdquo; Dawn said. She held her hands. &amp;ldquo;We want you to be happy. That&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;ve ever wanted for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And for you to be proud of us,&amp;rdquo; Donny added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God, I am,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Look at you two. My smart, strong, beautiful children. What mother wouldn&amp;#39;t give her eyeteeth to have you as her kids?&amp;rdquo; She hugged them again, one arm around each of her children&amp;#39;s waists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dawn met Donny&amp;#39;s eyes. They didn&amp;#39;t have to say a word. The bond between them, enhanced, perhaps, by their recent joining, allowed them to communicate on an instinctive level. Donny peeled away from Dawn and his mother, allowing his sister to enfold Katherine in a soft, loving embrace. Her hands were firm, and both Donny and Cindy watched avidly as she placed a series of gentle kisses on Katherine&amp;#39;s cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey, don&amp;#39;t I get a kiss?&amp;rdquo; Donny said, interrupting his sister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No way!&amp;rdquo; Dawn giggled. &amp;ldquo;Boys have cooties!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t want one from you,&amp;rdquo; Donny said. &amp;ldquo;I want one from Mom. She&amp;#39;s better looking anyway,&amp;rdquo; he continued, throwing Dawn a wink.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Right,&amp;rdquo; Kat said sarcastically, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;#39;d rather have a kiss from your old mom than your twin sister.&amp;rdquo; Reluctantly she disengaged from her daughter. She was surprised at how much she enjoyed being held by her. Deep inside, her belly warmed. At the same time, her lips tingled, and she suddenly became aware of the sensual feeling of her lace bra cupping her breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;#39;s going on? Usually I only feel like this after I&amp;#39;ve had a glass of wine and I&amp;#39;m going to read a sexy book. As she stepped towards Donny, she blushed, unaccountably self-conscious at the thought of giving her good-looking son a kiss, no matter how innocent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Donny placed his hands on Kat&amp;#39;s hips, not daring to pull her close enough to feel his raging erection. Inwardly, he thanked God he was wearing a loose shirt and shorts which hid his arousal. Smiling slightly, he bent his his head, his lips gently nuzzling her cheek. Greatly daring, he allowed his breath to whisper softly into the hollow of Kat&amp;#39;s ear, and he felt her shiver in his hands." />

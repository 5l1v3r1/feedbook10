  <title>The Abduction of Veronica X -  Lizbeth Dusseau, Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Would you be part of a club where morals were changed to fit the savage needs of its members? Would you participate in the abduction of a true innocent? Enjoy her defilement? Relish in the darkening of her soul? Then cast her back into the world with her never knowing who marked her life forever? The Writer&#39;s Club is such a group, driven by the pagan soul of its leader, Emerson Gray. The three female members become the property of Emerson and his friends, submitting to wild rituals of carnal savagery conducted in an old vacation cottage buried deep in the woods. Although it may sound like the perfect arrangement for a hedonistic band of non-conformists, no matter how far they sink into their own decadence, something more is always needed. This time that something will be known as veronica x, an innocent virgin to be abducted and used for their sexually perverse desires. The night that veronica x arrives bound in a burlap sack, the three women, Daphne, Penelope and Kathy Ann are frightened, certain that Emerson has gone too far. And yet, they too succumb to the deviant pleasure of their innocent toy, as they systematically win her compliance. She&#39;s left naked, blindfolded and bound in the cellar, where the sensory deprivation is interrupted only by sessions of sexual massage. Within days, the increasingly aroused girl responds to her captors, giving in to their lurid whims and her own natural lust. Her virginity is ripped away; she&#39;s used for oral pleasure, anal sex, bondage, punishment and humiliation. Before long, she can&#39;t stop the carnal drive that fires her body. It almost seems as if she&#39;s willingly consented to this pleasure-seeking revelry. But what happens when the six have had enough of the girl and veronica x is returned to her real life? Was the seduction of their captive complete? Will she hunt them down and make them pay for their terrible crime? Or will she move on undaunted, while her captors deal with the astounding reality of what they have become in the wilderness of their lawless lives?" />

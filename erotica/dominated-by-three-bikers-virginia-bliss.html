  <title>Dominated By Three Bikers - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily works in a bar, alone at the end of long day. But tonight she is going to be put to work in a different way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three hot, alpha male bikers have decided to teach her a real good lesson. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once, rough, hard and without protection. And Lily is all to willing to submit to their animal desire and frenzied lust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I had been confident that I could try until I actually got an eyeful of the customers. Three men, perhaps in their late twenties, clad in leather jackets. They were burly, brawny men, and the sheer difference in our presumed strength made me worried for my safety. They did not look like they&amp;#39;d be leaving here without a drink.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No - I couldn&amp;#39;t let myself give in. I had to prove to myself that I could be strong, that I could stand up for myself. Puffing out my chest, head held high, I made my way over to the group of men, who were eyeing me up in the usual manner. I tried not to let it get to me. I couldn&amp;#39;t be swayed by something so trivial right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Excuse me,&amp;quot; I began, voice wavering ever so slightly as I tried to choke the next words out. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re closing very soon, I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s enough time left for me to prepare drinks for you gentlemen. I&amp;#39;d love it if you were to come back tomorrow night, however.&amp;quot; I smiled, trying to compensate for my nervousness with cuteness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The men looked at each other, as though trying to silently decide which one of them would be tasked with beating me up. I was already starting to reach for my phone - I knew that it was unlikely that men like these would hurt a young lady like myself, but it was certainly a possibility, and that fact frightened me." />

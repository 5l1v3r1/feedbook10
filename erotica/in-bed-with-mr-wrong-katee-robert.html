  <title>In Bed with Mr. Wrong - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brianne Nave is never doing her friends a favor again. When they begged her to go on a blind date, she didn&#39;t expect someone so perfectly gorgeous. She&#39;s a mousy librarian--totally not in this man&#39;s league. And judging by his odd reaction when she opens the door, he knows it, too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Air Force Pararescuer Ryan Flannery avoids his hometown at all costs. He&#39;s not thrilled about the date until he&#39;s shocked silent by the prickly little librarian&#39;s sweet curves and kissable lips...and her smart mouth. But then an argument leads to a kiss that spirals out of control. How can two people have so little chemistry outside the bedroom when they fit together so perfectly in it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their friends strand them in a cabin to &quot;work things out,&quot; Bri&#39;s not sure whether to kill him or put the industrial-sized box of condoms they find to use. Bottom line--Ryan&#39;s career military and hates the tiny town she loves. He&#39;ll leave, just like everyone else in her life. And if she&#39;s foolish enough to give him her heart, he&#39;ll take it with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Out of Uniform series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* In Bed with Mr. Wrong&lt;br&gt;* His to Keep&lt;br&gt;* Falling for His Best Friend&lt;br&gt;* His Lover to Protect&lt;br&gt;* His to Take&lt;/p&gt;" />

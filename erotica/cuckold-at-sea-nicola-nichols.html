  <title>Cuckold At Sea - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything is better in the salt air. So I talked my husband Freddy into taking me on a Caribbean cruise to the Cayman Islands. He doesn&#39;t get excited easily, but knowing I&#39;m banging other men, seeing it, turns him on. I&#39;m thinking that if he&#39;s tied up and has to see me have hard and hot unprotected sex with several guys, it might give him the wonderfully nasty ideas I need him to have.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;We are going to take a Caribbean cruise,&quot; I told him.
Freddy stared at me blankly. A lot of what I tell my husband results in a blank stare. When you aren&#39;t talking business, he loses the thread easily. &quot;We are?&quot;
&quot;You promised me we could take some time off when you got the contract, and that&#39;s what I want. I&#39;ve picked it out.&quot; And I had. I&#39;d read about it in a magazine. I&#39;d already booked a Caribbean cruise leaving Miami for the Cayman Islands and looked forward to days of sun and fun. We&#39;d have perpetual room service, hot guys around the ship&#39;s pool, and Freddy wouldn&#39;t be able to escape to work. It sounded perfect for me. How Freddy reacted remained to be seen. But I had things in mind for him.
As I expected, Freddy was reluctant but willing. I&#39;ve gotten him trained in that respect. He&#39;s learned that doing what I tell him can lead to interesting times. Also, I let him know, in no uncertain terms, that I wanted this a lot. I wanted it enough that I&#39;d made the reservations and would do all the planning and packing for both of us. All he had to do was arrange for time off from work.
&quot;You&#39;ll be glad you did.&quot; I knew he would. I intended to make it a cruise to remember, just as I&#39;d turned some of my other fantasies into moments Freddy would remember.
I bought top-of-the-line tickets. What was Freddy&#39;s money good for if not to make life comfortable? When we got off the plane in Miami and the cruise line had a driver waiting to take us to the dock.

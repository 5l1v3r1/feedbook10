  <title>Ellie&#39;s First Pounding - Scarlet Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ellie is eighteen and has never been kissed. Frustrated, she has developed a crush on her handsome step-uncle, Leo. She knows nothing will ever come of it, but she still enjoys flirting with him.
Unknown to Ellie, Leo feels the same way. And he is going to do something about it; drive her to a deserted spot, bend her over the trunk of his car—and give Ellie her first pounding!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
He glanced across at her. She was blushing, embarrassed. It made her even more attractive. He wondered if she was blushing all over…
&quot;Single? He replied. &quot;I find that very difficult to believe, a pretty girl like you? Surely all the boys at school are chasing after you?&quot; He was flirting with her, he realized. For a moment he felt guilty. But only for a moment. &quot;Come on. You must have loads of offers?&quot;
Her entire body felt hot, reacting to Mr Miller&#39;s line of questioning. She didn&#39;t want to admit it though, and she felt her face grow a deeper shade of red. Was he into her? He was married after all.
&quot;No sir. No offers.&quot; She said quietly and looked down at her feet. &quot;I&#39;m too quiet for most of them.&quot; She added, trying to explain herself.
&quot;Oh, I see. Well, I&#39;ve always said it’s the quiet ones that you have to watch out for.&quot; Was he reading this wrong? Was this little hottie really flirting with him? And if so—what was he going to do about it?" />

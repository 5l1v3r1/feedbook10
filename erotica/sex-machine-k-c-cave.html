  <title>Sex Machine - K.C. Cave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alison&#39;s reputation as a sexual athlete catches up to her—science wants to model her libido for a high-tech sex robot! Her GF, Moriah is next—except for one problem: She&#39;s a virgin. The computer model requires P.I.V. experience with at least 4 men. So Alison arranges for GF to be the main attraction at a bachelor&#39;s party.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
The customer, in a gray three-piece suit that screamed lawyer, sat opposite the desk as Tommy sank back in his office chair. The guy had picked up his Mercedes the week before. A problem with the front-end job?
Nope. It was about a visit to a crummy east-side bar two years ago. Tommy had set up a gang bang for Alison, his long-time sex buddy. And played traffic cop to make sure the it ran smoothly as seven lucky guys took turns in a back room.
“You probably don’t remember me, but I remember you,” the guy said to Tommy over the blast of pneumatic wrenches. “You ran interference for a young lady who, uh, was entertaining some men on a busted pool table.”
“You a cop?”
“No, one of the customers, although I guess that’s not the right word, since she was free. Highly remarkable, considering how beautiful she was.”
“It might’ve been me.”
“I’m looking for that young lady,” he said and leaned forward. “This is going to sound fantastical, but it’s about an investment. Long story, so I’ll cut to the chase. After you and the young lady left, all seven of us lucky males who had enjoyed her services sat at the bar. We all agreed. She was absolutely, bar-none, the best any of us had ever had.”
“I’ll pass the compliment along.”
“Even Mike, the black guy who gets more high quality sex in a week than most of us get in a year, said she was extraordinary.”
“So?”
“I’m working with a scientific concern that’s developing a sex surrogate using robotics and virtual reality. Know what a sex surrogate is?”
“A woman who has sex for therapeutic reasons, I think. Help guys who can’t get off.”
“That’s right. I’m heading up a venture capital group to get this thing on solid financial footing. The goal is to fully automate a female sexual surrogate using robotics, micro sensors, body imaging and, most importantly, virtual reality. This isn’t going to be a cheap, inflatable sex doll. Or a high-quality silicone corpse that looks great, but just lays there. Using vision goggles, tactile simulators, sound, aroma, and, yes, direct genital stimulation, it’s a system that will respond and even initiate sex with a man. There’s a huge need.”
“That many men can’t get their rocks off?”
“It’s amazing the number of sexually dysfunctional males who need skilled therapy for problems like anxiety, body-image issues and premature ejaculation. Yet skilled, legitimate sex surrogates are scarce. It is, to put it mildly, a niche occupation that’s easily confused with prostitution.”
“Because it is prostitution, right?”
“No, it’s not. Sexual services for pay in a therapeutic situation are not illegal.”
“Dude, I strongly suspect—hell, I know—a lot of hookers who say their work is highly therapeutic.”
The guy held a hand up. “No argument. Regardless, a fully functional sex robot can fill that void. Our team is about ninety-five percent of the way there, but we’ve hit a snag.”
“Something that Alison can fix?”
“So that’s her name. Yeah, Alison can fill a void. We need to profile a fully sexually responsive woman for our computer models.”
“Profile? What’s that involve?”
“Basically, touching herself while hooked up to a bunch of probes and sensors.... In a room lighted with overhead fluorescents and geeks running around with clipboards.”
“In the nude?”
“Of course. It’s a scenario that shuts down the sexual responsiveness of most women…but that&#39;s what we need.”
Tommy looked up for the first time. “Alison’s your girl.”

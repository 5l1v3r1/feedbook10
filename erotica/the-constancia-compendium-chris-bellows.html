  <title>The Constancia Compendium -  Chris Bellows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Constancia Compendium is a Femdom Featurette containing Lady Constance Constancia Island &amp; Behavioral Modification: Lessons From Constancia Island. This is classic Femdom fiction with several unique twists making it a fascinating read for those who enjoy a world where women rule and men submit. An Interview with Lady Constance on D/s relationships for &quot;The American Society of Behavior Modification&quot; begins with a discussion of the Lady&#39;s relationship with &quot;boy&quot;, a submissive male who&#39;s captive at her European clinic - trained and kept in bondage by Jasmine, a powerful black nurse. The reader follows along through boy&#39;s morning ritual - interrogation, inspection, cleansing and milking. Constancia Island, an exclusive Caribbean paradise is a sovereign country designed exclusively for the institution of Female Domination and male submission... where troubled young males, at one time destined for lives of crime, are treated as beasts of burden, pony-boys, not only for the amusement of the island&#39;s defacto queen, Lady Constance, but as the island&#39;s sole method of conveyance for visitors and residents alike. After a trying business trip, Mrs Dalton returns home to find that her submissive husband has strayed. Hiring a professional dominatrix to satisfy his needs, he is caught in the most comprising of positions. It will be the last time. Mrs. Dalton learns there is an opening for training at Constancia Island, the exotic tropical isle owned by Lady Constance and long used as the facility of last resort for protecting the public from incorrigible young males. Whisked away on the next flight to the Caribbean, the following morning, Mr. Dalton finds himself barraged by dominant females and immersed into a program of training, grueling physical duress and torment, and deep psychological transformation." />

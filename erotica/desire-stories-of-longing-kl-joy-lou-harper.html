      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever....  Desired a peek behind forbidden doors? Desired someone so much you were willing to do anything? Desired to go deeper, hotter, stronger with someone?  Lady Vivianne has all that she could ever want: a growing corsetry business, dear friend Victor and Kate and her faithful submissive Rhiannon. Is there such a thing as too much success, though? With her business impinging on her personal space, and her past knocking her sideways, Vivianne finds herself snowed under. Fortunately her mentor Victor steps in with some offers that seem too good to be true.   Belle a budding submissive is sent in my Victor to help Vivianne, but the mutual attraction between her and Belle fires Rhiannon&#39;s spirit. Vivianne finds herself torn between lovers, and loosing grip on her control... will this time be more than even her closest friends and allies can pull her back from?   The second book in the &#39;Stories of...&#39; series delves deeper into the world of BDSM.  Are you ready for the ride?" />

  <title>Psychophobia Part One: The Boyfriend - A. K. Fagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cecilia Reese is a normal girl with normal dreams: graduate college, meet Mr. Right, get a job, get married, and live a content, if not average, life. She&#39;s well on her way to reaching one of her dreams - graduating college - when she meets Caine Erikson, who will forever alter her future.  She just doesn&#39;t know it yet.  Criminal psychopaths are to be feared, certainly. They feel no remorse for their crimes, no empathy for their victims, and are often smart enough to get away with their crimes if they don&#39;t get bored. But how can you tell them apart from the crowd when they know how to blend in just as well as anyone else?  Cecilia certainly can&#39;t, and that leaves her vulnerable to Caine&#39;s machinations. Psychophobia means &quot;fear of the mind,&quot; and there is much to fear about Caine&#39;s mind.  Much more than Cecilia, or anyone else, could ever know." />

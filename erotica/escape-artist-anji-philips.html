  <title>Escape Artist - Anji Philips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Crystal&amp;#39;s husband is a cop; his gambling is out of control and he&amp;#39;s getting abusive. Meeting a sexy and ambitious young guy who wants to be a famous escape artist gets her some hot sex and an idea. Her neighbor, Ron, is also a cop. He doesn&amp;#39;t like her husband but he&amp;#39;s definitely interested in her. All she needs is a plan that lets her enjoy them both and also make her own great escape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Michael is a poor magician,&amp;quot; Jeannie explained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am an escape artist,&amp;quot; he corrected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whatever.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And poor as in impoverished, not as in bad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeannie laughed. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s a good, but poor escape artist magician type. He says he needs to establish himself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is it hard to establish yourself?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Michael was tall, with a twisted, ironic smile that made him look more interesting than handsome. &amp;quot;Not if you are good at it, which I am. Unfortunately, it takes money to let the world know you are good.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laughed at that. &amp;quot;What doesn&amp;#39;t take money? In my case, if I had money, divorcing Paul would be easy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;With a little money, I could move out into my own place. I&amp;#39;d keep him at a distance, hire a good lawyer and be set up.&amp;quot; Without money, she had fewer options. And even if she won a decent settlement, Paul didn&amp;#39;t make enough to support two households. So even if he was actually paying alimony she&amp;#39;d need a stupid job, and that he&amp;#39;d pay her wasn&amp;#39;t at all certain. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of job skills,&amp;quot; she told him. &amp;quot;My work experience is limited to being a hostess or waitress.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I understand,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But for you, it&amp;#39;s different. How would having money show the world what you can do?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d use it to make a splash. To break into the big time, you need a major trick-one that will look good on television. Then you need to film it. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be fancy, but the trick has to be elegant.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She giggled. &amp;quot;Which suggests a joke: Why is an escape artist like a hooker?&amp;quot; He shrugged. &amp;quot;They both need a good trick.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He had laughed. That made her like him more, seeing that he could laugh at himself. His smile could be sexy as well as ironic. It was a mobile face. She liked him, but he was slippery, elusive. He&amp;#39;d be hard to get to know, and harder to trust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They walked out on the balcony and Michael lit a joint, took a drag and handed it to her. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve designed one,&amp;quot; he said as she took a hit, inhaling the smoke. He laughed again. &amp;quot;A trick, I mean. I can&amp;#39;t afford to build it, but I know that it would definitely do what I want.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not that I can invest, but how much would you need?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He chewed on the idea. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve cost it out at four grand. With five grand I could make it spectacular. And then there is promotion, advertising. So I&amp;#39;d prefer to have six grand. I could do it for less, but you only get one shot to break in and I&amp;#39;m not going with less than that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So this is a big deal for you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded. &amp;quot;Very. It&amp;#39;s my future.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you&amp;#39;re saving up?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed again. &amp;quot;I earn so little doing the kid&amp;#39;s shows and busking that I barely have enough to live on. There is nothing to save.&amp;quot; He grimaced. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t this go on much longer.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly a memory popped into her head. A fantasy, really, but one that might be developed into something like a plan." />

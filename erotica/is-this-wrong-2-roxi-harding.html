~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Matthew picks up his bottle of beer and takes a sip, putting it back down before looking at the script in his hand.
&quot;So just read the line?&quot; he asks Gracie, his 18-year old stepsister. She smiles and nods.
&quot;Yep. I just want to make sure I know all of mine,&quot; she says.
Matthew looks at the script again. &quot;This is the last straw, sweetheart. Now you&#39;ve gone and made me mad.&quot;
&quot;Why do you think you can play games with me?&quot; Gracie responds. &quot;Just because what we had didn&#39;t last doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t happen again.&quot;
Gracie&#39;s eyes are on her stepbrother&#39;s. She hesitates.
Matthew feels distracted. Last week something happened…something he&#39;d never expected to happen. It was the middle of the day and he went upstairs where Gracie was having a shower. But for some reason that day she&#39;d forgotten to close the door. Matthew noticed it and at first he was just going to keep going...but something made him stop, tip-toe over, and look inside.
And there in the glass shower stall he saw his little sister, all grown up, her body filled out and completely a woman, naked and touching herself in the shower.
Matthew was shocked. He didn&#39;t know what to do. There was his own stepsister, and she was fingering herself right in front of him! Matthew couldn&#39;t help himself. He had to rush off to his bedroom and jerk off, right then and there. And since then it&#39;s been all he can think about.
&quot;Huh,&quot; Matthew says, reading ahead in the script. &quot;I guess...we kiss.&quot;
He looks up at his little sister and she nods. She takes a step towards her stepbrother, followed by another. He watches her approach him, and when she&#39;s finally in front of him, her neck craned to keep her eyes locked with his, it&#39;s only then that he sees how beautiful she really is.
Matthew swallows as a bead of sweat rolls down his forehead.
He&#39;s been feeling horny all day, and Gracie just looks so hot. If she were anybody but his own stepsister, or if he were a lesser man, he would have taken her the moment she turned 18. But he&#39;s been good. He&#39;s been holding himself back.
The only issue is...he doesn&#39;t know how much longer he can hold.
Gracie never really noticed before just how incredible her stepbrother looks. He&#39;s big, strong, and she can even smell him—a deep, manly scent. His musk.
She&#39;s shocked to feel herself getting wet. Deep inside she feels the need to be filled, and filled up by him. She looks longingly up into his eyes.
&quot;Matthew?&quot; Gracie says to her stepbrother. &quot;Can I tell you something?&quot;
&quot;Well sure, kiddo,&quot; Matthew says. &quot;You know you can tell me anything.&quot;
Gracie looks at him, not sure how to word this. How to even begin.
&quot;Well,&quot; she says. &quot;You know you&#39;ve always told me to be myself?&quot; And Matthew nods. &quot;Well, I think I&#39;ve figured out what I want to be.&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Matthew says. &quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot;
Gracie swallows, looking deep into her stepbrother&#39;s eyes. &quot;I think I want to become pregnant.&quot;
Matthew blinks, looking at his little sister. She looks back at him, feeling nervous, tingly all over.

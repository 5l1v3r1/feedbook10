  <title>Satan&#39;s Sisters -  Paul Moore, Paul Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chrissy is a sassy co-ed with nothing on her mind except good times and great sex, breezing through school by trading her sexual favors for high marks. When her roommate proposes a wager, betting her that she can&#39;t get an &quot;A&quot; from Dr. Cornell, Chrissy takes the bait. She doesn&#39;t know that Dr. Cornell is a lonely widow, or that she is a dominant lesbian with a tortured past and an appetite for young girls. This is the story of a dominant/submissive relationship as seen from two points of view - above and below. A startling tale of female bisexuality, spanking, whipping, humiliation and anal discipline; shackles, cages, dildos, enemas and creative bondage. &quot;&#39;I have her! She is mine!&#39; Lying on a mattress in the back of the van is a twenty year old woman-child of perfect beauty. She is blindfolded, gagged, and bound. When I get her home; I intend to abuse her savagely. The small part of my conscience that retains sanity and morality recoils in horror while the naked imp of lust capers and dances.&quot;" />

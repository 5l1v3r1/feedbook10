  <title>Her Intimate Fix - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mattie&amp;#39;s boss, Otto, is a mean guy with a huge xxx, but she has to keep him happy. Her son Connor, a teen with a full-ride scholarship to college, hates the way Otto treats his mom.

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mattie&amp;#39;s son Connor lay on his bed, back home to visit his mom for the weekend from Gainesville. In the warm evening, he was lounging around in his underpants, just plain white briefs. He liked the university campus, which was full of hot young babes. Most of his classes were easy for a dedicated student like himself. That gave him way too much time to dwell on his non-existent sex life and all the hot babes who wanted nothing to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His window was open, so he heard his mom trudging toward the single-wide home and up the front steps. He knew the drill by now; he should leave her alone until she showered, changed, and sat down in the living room with a beer. She had taught him that throughout his life. Once she was sitting down, he was welcome to talk to her if he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After he heard the hissing of the shower at the other end of the trailer and later the thump of the refrigerator closing, he walked out to the living room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey, Mom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Connor? Why are you up so late?&amp;quot; Mattie, standing in the kitchen wearing her short, light-weight white robe, took a long swig of beer from a bottle. Her curly brown hair was still shiny with conditioner. The robe was see-through, revealing her big tits, and it was loosely tied anyway, as though she wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about her appearance. She didn&amp;#39;t seem to notice he was in his underpants, given that he often wore no more than that in all the years he was growing up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No reason,&amp;quot; said Connor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Shouldn&amp;#39;t you be in bed?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I stay up late at college, so I sleep late in the morning. I&amp;#39;m wide awake right now. No worries.&amp;quot; He could see the beautiful curve of her waist and hips, as well as her dark, neatly trimmed bush, through the fabric of her robe. The short robe barely came down far enough to cover her bush and butt anyhow. In the heat and humidity of Florida, she had raised him with a casual attitude toward nudity, so this sight was nothing new. He had always liked looking at her, though, from childhood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come sit down.&amp;quot; Mattie plunked down on the couch, across from the loud, straining window air conditioner." />

~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
I woke up in chains, my body covered in bruises I didn&amp;#39;t remember getting. My wrists were bound behind my back and my ankles were shackled to a metal rod, three feet apart, keeping my legs spread wide.&lt;br /&gt;
Cold air blew against me from the air conditioning unit on the wall, sending shivers down my spine. I tried to pull against the chains holding my arms in place, but they were firmly wrapped around my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;
I was in my underwear, the rest my clothes were cut into pieces beside me. Remnants of my favorite blue dress was scattered all around me. My heart ached for the dress. It was comfortable and classy. Cost me a week&amp;#39;s salary. I knew I should be worrying about something else altogether, something more dire. Like being kidnapped and bound in chains. But my brain didn&amp;#39;t want to go there yet.&lt;br /&gt;
My hair fell over my eyes and I tried to figure out where I was. Light shone in from the gap in the window blinds. The room was small and debilitated, too old to be my own. It was completely bare, with nothing in that betrayed the man&amp;#39;s identity.&lt;br /&gt;
The last thing I remembered was having a drink in the bar. And then, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
Did I look away? I was careful not to let the drink leave my sight. I knew the dangers of being drugged in a bar. I didn&amp;#39;t even drink. What was I doing in a bar in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;
Something fell in another room and I jerked against the bondage. There was a wall of pictures behind me.&lt;br /&gt;
I twisted around and stared at it, my eyes widening in disbelief from what I saw. It was me, in various places, doing mundane, everyday things. Me getting a cup of coffee, me walking to walk, me in my bathrobe&amp;hellip; I turned back towards the door, trying the decipher the noises coming from it. It sounded like people arguing&amp;hellip;with their fists.&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;d been kidnapped, that much was certain, but by whom? To what end? I was a psychologist. My clients were couples with relationship problems, couples who couldn&amp;#39;t talk without resorting to thinly-veiled insults, couples who needed help. No one violent.&lt;br /&gt;
Not my clients. I tried to remember what happened to get me here.&lt;br /&gt;
Why was I drinking in the first place? I was upset. Something terrible had happened and I was very upset. Something in the news.&lt;br /&gt;
My memory came back to me in bits and pieces. I was alone in the bar, glass of whiskey in my hand. My fingers trembled when I picked it up and put it to my lips but I downed it in one shot. It burned my throat.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I told you I&amp;#39;d find you,&amp;quot; a familiar voice said from behind me. Goose bumps rose on the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;
Realization dawned on me like a pile of bricks. There was a reason why I was alone in a bar. He had just been released on early parole.&lt;br /&gt;
I stood up, fully intent on running away, but my legs failed me.&lt;br /&gt;
Adam grabbed me as I fell." />

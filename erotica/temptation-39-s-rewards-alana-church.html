      <meta name="description" content="When temptation beckons, it&amp;#39;s best to give in! That&amp;#39;s what these loving families find out when sexy opportunities come their way. For the first time, four of Alana Church&amp;#39;s best sellers are in one steamy anthology. Sit back and enjoy as sisters, cousins, mothers and brothers satisfy themselves, and each other!&lt;br /&gt;
Includes: &lt;i&gt;While the Cat&amp;#39;s Away&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, The Mice Will Play&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, Cutting Ties&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and Cutting Loose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; said Cindy. &amp;ldquo;Strip.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What? No,&amp;rdquo; Katherine said, turning red. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m not getting naked in front of you two.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Really?&amp;rdquo; Cindy asked. &amp;ldquo;Well, if you insist,&amp;rdquo; she smiled, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;#39;ll get Donny up here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Katherine sputtered incoherently. Cindy hugged her aunt. &amp;ldquo;Kat, it isn&amp;#39;t a sin to be proud of what God gave you.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now I know, that Mom and Dad gave you nice clothes on Christmas and your birthday&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, too,&amp;rdquo; Dawn said helpfully.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dawn!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come on, Momma. Where did you hide the clothes Uncle Edward and Aunt Carol sent you?&amp;rdquo; she asked, her voice so appealing Kat gave up and pointed at the bureau.&lt;br /&gt;
Dawn sprang to action, but was halted by Cindy&amp;#39;s voice. &amp;ldquo;Dawn, you&amp;#39;re your momma&amp;#39;s size. How about you get some of your own things for her to try out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Once she left, Cindy opened the drawers of the bureau, seeing layers of fashionable blouses and slacks, comfortable skirts and sundresses. Even a selection of lingerie; silk panties and bras folded neatly, some of them with the tags still attached.&lt;br /&gt;
She met Katherine&amp;#39;s gaze. &amp;ldquo;Let me help you, Kat,&amp;rdquo; she said softly.&lt;br /&gt;
Katherine&amp;#39;s eyes closed as she fought a visible battle within herself. Finally she lifted her hands and began to unbutton her blouse.&lt;br /&gt;
In a few minutes, Dawn came pelting back into the bedroom, arms full of clothes. She looked at her mother and whistled. &amp;ldquo;Dang, Momma. You gave me an eyeful last night, but I forgot how gorgeous you are. Hmmm,&amp;rdquo; she said, riffling through the soft pile of fabric. &amp;ldquo;Oh, look at these,&amp;rdquo; she said, handing out a shimmering scrap of pale blue cloth.&lt;br /&gt;
In moments Katherine was wearing a pair of silk panties, the waistband riding high on her hips, accenting the slimness of her waist. Before she could protest, her daughter had cozened her into putting on the matching bra.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There, doesn&amp;#39;t that feel better?&amp;rdquo; her niece asked. She cocked an eye at her cousin. &amp;ldquo;Dawn, take your clothes off, will you? I want to compare you two.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Smiling, Dawn skinned out of her shorts and top. Side by side, mother and daughter looked in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good grief,&amp;rdquo; came Cindy&amp;#39;s voice. She looked at the two of them, shaking her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dawn might be an inch shorter. But the two of you are so close together you might as well be sisters. Even your boobs are the same size.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They&amp;#39;re not that big,&amp;rdquo; protested Kat.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Whatever they are, they&amp;#39;re lovely. Kat, if you let me help you out, you&amp;#39;ll be beating men off with a stick.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Kat glared at her feet and muttered something inaudible.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She said she doesn&amp;#39;t want to beat men off with a stick,&amp;rdquo; Cindy said, her voice soft with sympathy. She turned to her mother. &amp;ldquo;Momma, Cindy&amp;#39;s right. There is no reason you can&amp;#39;t feel good about yourself. Why not be comfortable and look beautiful?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Cindy&amp;#39;s head came to rest near her own, her breath warm in her ear. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;#39;t really have a choice, Aunt Kat. If you don&amp;#39;t start wearing these nice clothes my parents bought you, I&amp;#39;m going to toss the old ones on a bonfire when you are at work tomorrow. Then what will you do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Moving quickly, Kat picked out a pair of loose beige shorts from Dawn&amp;#39;s pile of clothes and a light, rose-colored blouse Carol had sent her three years ago. Putting them on, she turned to her judges, asking for their approval.&lt;br /&gt;
Cindy pursed her lips, a wicked gleam in her eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have an idea,&amp;rdquo; she said." />

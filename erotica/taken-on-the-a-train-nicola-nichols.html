  <title>Taken on the &quot;A&quot; Train - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A hotwife riding the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; Train, a renovated luxury train running overnight from Boston to Chicago, is looking for fun. While her husband is doing business, she meets a man who gets her into a serious party.

&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s fun, but what happens they arrive in Chicago?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was supposed to be quite the thing. If you believed the news, it would be one of the not-to-be-missed social events of the year. And it was rather retro, too. I liked that. All of it. I needed a party of some kind&amp;nbsp; something different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was the relaunch of the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; train, its inaugural run from on the route from Boston&amp;#39;s Back Bay Station bound for Chicago. It had been some years since it last ran and had undergone a major renovation in an attempt to regain its splendor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once upon a time, the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; train had been a posh way for the ultra-rich to travel between Beantown and what was a financial center. Planes and car travel had pre-empted it and it had fallen into disuse. Now someone had the idea of bringing it back, making rail travel glamorous again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, it was all over the news about how they&amp;#39;d tracked down the original posh railroad cars and had brought them back to their original glory. Times had changed, and with air travel becoming utilitarian, I guess the idea was to make this an upmarket run that was an attraction itself. Luxury travel, the way a cruise ship is supposed to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The train itself is the destination,&amp;quot; is what the flyer Hank had handed me said. My husband had bought us tickets and then felt he had to sell it to me. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s going to be a big party of the kind of people you like,&amp;quot; he told me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They threw all sorts of things at it. &amp;quot;Take the &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; Train&amp;quot; was the refrain you heard on the ads that seemed to run continuously on television.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While a big party, something different like that can be fun, sometimes they try too hard to make them interesting. It can sound desperate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been looking for something different.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s what my husband said. And it was true. He knows I like parties; he also knew that I was getting bored with most of the regular ones in the city. They&amp;#39;d become little more than the same people trying to find clever ways to not be bored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hank had his own reasons for wanting to go. He&amp;#39;s a deal maker and figured this would be a venue that gave him access to different people. It would give him a chance to do business&amp;nbsp; to schmooze with the rich and famous. Besides, it involved trains. Hank had always loved trains. He had posters of trains in his office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll take the &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; Train, just like in the Duke Ellington song,&amp;quot; he said. That was what they played in the commercials for it... the Duke&amp;#39;s old arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You got us a sleeper?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head. &amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t have any on the first run, even though it&amp;#39;s an overnight trip. It will be nonstop partying. There will be food and drinks; in fact, there will be an open bar. At the price they are charging...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I imagine it will be crowded and probably quite insane.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled. &amp;quot;You know it will be. I expect a lot of people will dress in period costumes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Crowded and quite insane meant different things to the two of us. For him it meant fantastic networking opportunities; for me, it meant diving into the insanity of a party atmosphere. In this case, anonymous partying, which can get rather wild and fun." />

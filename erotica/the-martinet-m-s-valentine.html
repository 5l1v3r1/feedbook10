  <title>The Martinet - M. S. Valentine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This tale of erotic intrigue tells the story of those who by some act of folly become enslaved as an alternative form of punishment by the mysterious masked figure known only as The Martinet. In his Moorish castle in 17th Century Spain, these young men and women discover that class and privilege are insignificant. Whether prince or daughter of nobility, they have no more power than a lowly stable hand as they serve in every sexual capacity demanded of them by The Martinet&amp;#39;s aristocratic guests.&amp;nbsp;For those slaves who arrive from a life of domestic service, The Castle will be a place in which they can for the first time know what it is to dominate another... whereas their enslaved betters will be given much cause to lament the scandalous actions that prompted their dispatch to The Martinet.&amp;nbsp;Whatever the case, there are many lessons to be learned at The Castle. Yet perhaps the most important will be learned by The Martinet, as he finds himself increasingly captivated by the beautiful daughter of an English earl, who has unwillingly become the most popular female slave at The Castle.&lt;br /&gt;

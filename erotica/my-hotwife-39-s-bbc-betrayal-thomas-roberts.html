&lt;br /&gt;
Carrie arrived breathless after four in the afternoon. Her face was a bright pink and her hair was a mess. She was wearing a thin purple dress that ended at mid-thigh. One of the straps had fallen down her arm, revealing the lack of a bra strap. It didn&amp;#39;t matter, as she quickly stripped the dress off and threw it on the bed. My wife was completely naked underneath, which meant she&amp;#39;d walked into the hospital wearing only that light purple dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She threw herself at the glass wall in front of me. &amp;quot;Ryan, I was a bad girl!&amp;quot; she said breathlessly. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll probably divorce me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Slow down, Carrie. What happened?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I went to the placethe place where he waxed me. You remember, right? The big black guy?&amp;quot; She looked at me with wide eyes, her face now even more pink. &amp;quot;I asked him to show me the designs again, the tattoos&amp;quot; She had to stop to catch her breath. When she was ready to start again, she leaned her back against the wall next to the glass. If I stayed close, I could still catch her profile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He pushed me against the wall, Ryan. Just like this, and heand heoh God, Ryan!&amp;quot; She looked at me with fear in her eyes. &amp;quot;He kissed me, Ryan.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay, Carrie. That&amp;#39;s not so bad,&amp;quot; I told her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t understand, that&amp;#39;s not all he did. He kissed me and his lips were wonderful. They&amp;#39;re so full and soft. I lost myself in them, even when he started using his tongue. Oh, honey, it was so exciting. I&amp;#39;m so sorry I let that happen,&amp;quot; she said, but she didn&amp;#39;t look sorry. She looked like she had more to tell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all right, Carrie. Whatever happened, you&amp;#39;re here now. Just tell me everything,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He kissed my face, he even kissed my neck, and I moved my head so he could.&amp;quot; Carrie leaned her head on her left shoulder, exposing the long expanse of her neck. My wife&amp;#39;s perfect white complexion was marked my tiny red marks where he&amp;#39;d given her hickeys. Some big black guy had sucked on my wife&amp;#39;s neck and she&amp;#39;d let him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was shocked into silence by the sight. My heart hammered in my chest, jealousy flooded my system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;His mouth felt so good on my neck and throat,&amp;quot; Carrie said. Her head tilted back, exposing her throat to me. &amp;quot;I was moaning, Ryan. I could hear myself. I was moaning before he pushed my strap down my arm and touched me - there.&amp;quot; As if to demonstrate, Carrie used her left hand to cup herself. &amp;quot;He felt me, Ryan. It was so excited for him. Forgive me, honey. I liked it. I loved it. I know I moaned. I could hear myself.&amp;quot; Carrie was touching herself as she held her mouth as though she was still being kissedeven moving her tongue as though she were licking another man&amp;#39;s lips. &amp;quot;Then he forced his leg between my thighs. He made me part my legs while he kissed me and&amp;nbsp; touched me. It was like he owned me. I had to spread my legs for him. You see that, don&amp;#39;t you, honey? I had to spread my legs.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded dumbly, and removed my hospital gown so I could be as naked as she was. I heard my blood rushing in my ears." />

  <title>The Devil Goes to Work Too - Carlos B. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The devil Goes To Work Too masterfully weaves lifes colorful array of trials through the fabric of scriptural truth, forming a tapestry of hope. Such is the hope we find in Genesis 50:20   You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. 
Like Carlos Taylor, you too can equip yourself with the knowledge that Christs life and resurrection gives purpose to our existence. Through Christs redemptive Gospel, we have within us the unique power to arm ourselves with tools to defeat the devil. This is good news!
God is everywhere and His love for us is immeasurable. As The devil Goes To Work Too illustrates, nothing in our lives, including work, is excluded from His purview. The question lies in whether or not we trust Him for the next miraculous work hes planned for our life. God challenges us to ask ourselves whether or not were willing to go wherever he leads us without fear or reservation. In Romans 8:28, Scripture reminds us that God is at work in all things for our good." />

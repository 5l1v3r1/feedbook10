  <title>Happiness:  Hidden in Plain Sight - Jeanne Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our society bombards us with negativity, a lack of respect, and fear. We are losing our ability to find the good in others or in situations. We are unintentionally blind to natural beauty, and we lack the motivation to make positive changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness: Hidden in Plain Sight (A Response from Within) is the average persons guide to everyday psychological insights with an emphasis, not on analyzing why we are living by rote, but on how to make things much better! Realizing that happiness comes from within, not from others or possessions, is critical to a successful search for happiness. It is not something to be won or earned, but Gods gift to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a change, there now is a book that is actually practical; a book that not only discusses twenty of the most important therapeutic guidelines for a happier life, but also suggests hundreds of positive ideas. These ideas are designed to remind and motivate the reader to seek out the good things in life that are hidden in plain sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a professional therapist, and after meeting thousands of unhappy people, Jeanne has found that by taking specific positive actions and developing mindfulness, a person can immediately begin to experience a more peaceful and happy today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

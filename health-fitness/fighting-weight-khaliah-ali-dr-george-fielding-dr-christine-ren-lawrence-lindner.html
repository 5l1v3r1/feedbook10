  <title>Fighting Weight - Khaliah Ali, Dr. George Fielding, Dr. Christine Ren, Lawrence Lindner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khaliah Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali, shares her success at overcoming obesity through banding surgery&amp;#8212;a minimally invasive, reversible, and extremely effective choice for drastically overweight people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad Ali&#39;s daughter Khaliah hit 325 pounds, she didn&#39;t need to be told again that she was morbidly obese. A lifetime of dieting, of starving, had not helped. Miserable, depressed, and unable to walk up a flight of stairs without losing her breath, she did not know which way to turn&amp;#8212;until a friend pointed her toward a new type of surgery called gastric banding. It is just as effective as gastric bypass but with a fraction of potential complications. With the band placed around her stomach and completely taking away her hunger, Khaliah slimmed down to half her former size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khaliah wraps her story of weight loss in this memoir of what it was like to grow up the daughter of one of the world&#39;s most famous men, and teams up with her surgeons at the New York University Medical Center to detail the lifetime of misery suffered by an obese girl; the ins and outs of the banding operation; and the joy, serenity, and health resulting from a solution that until now had eluded her.&lt;/p&gt;" />

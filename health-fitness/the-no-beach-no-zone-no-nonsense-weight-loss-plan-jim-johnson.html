  <title>The No-Beach, No-Zone, No-Nonsense Weight-Loss Plan - Jim Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;THE NO-BEACH, NO-ZONE, NO-NONSENSE WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN is based entirely on:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* an analysis of scientific studies, so that it is fact-based&lt;BR&gt;* research on successful dieters that shows how they got the weight off and kept it off&lt;br&gt;* diet and exercise strategies that can be done at home&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What is currently on the market: a lot of diet and weight loss books with gimmicks and a lot of fluff, but very few theories that are supported by randomized controlled trials. THE NO-BEACH, NO-ZONE, NO-NONSENSE WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN is the antithesis of these books. The author has reviewed the weight loss literature, found proven solutions, and put it all in a digestible format for the lay person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book contains self-help information on&lt;br&gt;* calculating calorie needs and determining your BMI&lt;BR&gt;* the truth about cellulite and spot reducing&lt;BR&gt;* whether your weight is threatening your health&lt;BR&gt;* why your weight problem isn&#39;t all your fault&lt;BR&gt;* calculating the percentage of fats, carbs and protein in your diet&lt;BR&gt;* a little-known exercise strategy shown to work in many controlled trials&lt;BR&gt;* detachable exercise and calorie count cards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;THE NO-BEACH, NO-ZONE, NO-NONSENSE WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN is easy to read, practical, and contains a simple workable plan for anyone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

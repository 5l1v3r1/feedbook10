  <title>Step - Francis Perry Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walk through the fire. Fire is a purifier. Stress, pain, struggles, chaos, grief, rejection, fear, and failure is fi re. Walk through them all, and a brighter day will be there on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop. You have walked through enough mud and hurdled many obstacles. Silence is your friend. This is the time to search for peace. Listen to the voice of that little boy or girl that was you; listen to the dreams that were not answered. Listen to the inner voice that is speaking to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe your environment with a new outlook that has you in mind. This is the time to be wisely selfish. Can you see your future in a brighter day? Talking has been your excuse. Action is now your magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an obstacle? Is it a directional arrow, or is it a sign telling you to give up? Are you aware of the energy you are exuding? Are you aware of the energy you are living around? Redirect your motivation so it will help you live longer and help others understand you clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grow, you need to evaluate your presence and understand the changes you need to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at yourself; this is your current presence. Look back on your life and decipher the struggles and the celebration. Then turn around and live your life with God in mind in every STEP you take.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Twenty-First Century Nutrition and Family Health - Arnold V Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="80 years ago the rampant epidemics of obesity, coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes hardly existed. So why did they start? And why does no one seem able to bring them to an end? Twenty-First Century Nutrition and Family Health finally provides the answers. Meticulously researched from over 500 scientific papers, convincingly argued and engagingly written, research scientist Arnold Page dissects the mistakes, misrepresentations and vested interests that are costing the UK over £55 billion a year in healthcare and lost productivity. He then demonstrates how any family can enjoy good food and good health without spending a fortune in time or money. All parents concerned for the present and future health of their families need to read this ground-breaking book while there is still time to act. Discover, among many other things: * shocking truth about sugar * three major causes of heart disease and how to eliminate all three * to lose weight and keep it off without feeling hungry * common drink that reduces stress levels and the risk of strokes and other diseases * you and your kids can get a good night&#39;s sleep and stop feeling so tired * to keep your children&#39;s teeth totally free from decay and dental fluorosis * 25:45:30 Natural Health Diet * your whole family can learn to enjoy taking exercise and become super-fit * comprehensive manual for family health. Arnold Page is a professional research scientist who has authored some thirty technical publications. He is a professional member of the Nutrition Society, the Institution of Materials, Minerals &amp; Mining, and the Institute of Wood Science. After adopting the diet and exercise plan recommended in his book he climbed sixteen 3000ft high mountain peaks in 24 hours at the age of 70, while his wife Ann was able to stop taking medication for Type 2 diabetes. In his spare time he plays the &#39;cello and manages a charity that assists people in Chile." />

  <title>Rules of the Game - Neil Strauss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you want to play the Game, you&#39;ve got to know the Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his international bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;/em&gt;, Neil Strauss delved into the secret world of pick-up artists&amp;#8212;men who have created a science out of the art of seduction. Not only did he reveal the techniques that they had developed, but he became a master of The Game, and the world&#39;s No. 1 PUA, as Style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this bestselling companion, Strauss reduces three books of life-changing knowledge into a single-volume set. The first book, &lt;em&gt;The Stylelife Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, breaks down the knowledge he learned and techniques he invented into simple step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow to meet and land the women of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second book, Strauss takes readers into the dark side of The Game. &lt;em&gt;The Style Diaries&lt;/em&gt; offers a series of tales of seduction and sexual (mis)adventure. From accidentally getting married during a drunken night in Reykjavik, to luring a famous musician&#39;s granddaughter into a threesome; to the stress and frustration of the torturous and highly unorthodox &quot;30 Day Sex Experiment,&quot; &lt;em&gt;The Style Diaries&lt;/em&gt; takes you further into the seduction underworld than ever before. Finally, in the all-new, updated third volume, Strauss collects the greatest, most powerful, field-tested, word-for-word routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t need money, looks, or fame to succeed with women. All you need is an understanding of how attraction works&amp;#8212;and this thirty-day workout program for your social skills, which has already guided countless men from frustration to fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />

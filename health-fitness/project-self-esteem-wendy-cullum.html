  <title>Project Self-Esteem - Wendy Cullum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shyness, bullying, and depression can be a sad part of every childs school experience. Each of these problems can be traced back to a single sourcea lack of self-esteem. In my many years of working with children, I have found that the key to helping our kids succeed in life is building up their self-esteem at an early age. In this book are valuable life lessons that have been tried and tested for more than fifteen years by myself and other parents and teachers in their homes and classrooms. The subjects that are taught range from courage to forgiveness. The lessons are fun and uplifting and have profound effects on children and their self-esteem. When children feel they have value, they are happier and do better in school and in life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught the lesson for PSE on Joy Thank you so much for such a great lesson. I went to teach it to the kids (at their level) and left the classroom so encouraged and full of joy because I couldnt help but to understand the topic! The kids enjoyed all the activities, and we had such a fun time. Again, thank you so much for all the work you do to put this program together. It doesnt just impact the children; it was an amazing and timely reminder for me today!

&lt;p&gt;PSE is a wonderful program at our school! The valuable lessons and discussion points are age-appropriate and engaging. We appreciate how they are grade specific. Our students, teachers, and volunteers look forward to the activities and relatable topics each month.

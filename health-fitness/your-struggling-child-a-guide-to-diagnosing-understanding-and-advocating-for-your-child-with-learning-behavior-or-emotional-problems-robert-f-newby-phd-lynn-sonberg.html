  <title>Your Struggling Child: A Guide to Diagnosing, Understanding, and Advocating for Your Child with Learning, Behavior, or Emotional Problems - Robert F. Newby, PhD, Lynn Sonberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is a practical, compassionate book parents can turn to when they first recognize that their child has a &quot;problem&quot; &amp;#8211;&amp;#8211; but aren&#39;t sure what it is or where to seek help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this very moment, millions of children across the U.S. are falling behind in school, acting out impulsively at home, having problems making friends, suffering dramatic mood swings, and more. Their parents are frustrated and afraid, aware that something&#39;s wrong, but not sure where to turn for help or how to cope with their child&#39;s behavior. &quot;Is it a learning disorder, ADHD, anxiety disorder, or some combination?&quot; they wonder. &quot;Are these moods and behaviors normal or abnormal? Will my child outgrow them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book by a noted neuropsychologist explains the different and overlapping symptoms of learning, mood, and behavior disorders and guides parents in getting the right diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Newby demystifies the process and empowers parents. Step by step, he explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;How to observe and chart your child&#39;s behavior&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;a critical diagnostic tool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;What to expect during the evaluation and treatment process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;How to partner with medical and school professionals to assist your child and what to do when conflicts arise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clear and comprehensive, this supportive guide will be every parent&#39;s first line of defense in helping a troubled child.&lt;/p&gt;" />

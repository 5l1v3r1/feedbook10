  <title>Diabetes Never Again - Fredrerick Mickel Huck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The information contained in this book could eliminate or prevent diabetes. This is exciting news and I am excited to be able to share this with my
        world citizens. The methods that have been researched and used successfully will not harm anyone and have no adverse effects, as these methods only
        include a clean colon, consuming only nutritious foods and exercise. The methods are inexpensive and easy, particularly compared to   maintaining
        diabetes by senseless and very expensive medical intervention that has shown to be ineffective. The medical establishment has cost society billions of
        dollars, created more pain and suffering for the   diabetic and have failed to cure or even reduce the rise of this horrible problem. It seems that the
        medical industry is only interested in the great amount of money that diabetics are charged. It is hoped that this book will guide you away from the
        ineffective and expensive medical industry and will give you the time that is necessary to prevent or eliminate this disease. You, your family, or
        friends will have a diabetic free body by using this guidebook. Your quality of life will be excellent and you will live a long and healthy life. It is
        hoped that the reader will share the information in the book with others. It is a gift of great magnitude for loved ones and even strangers and should
        be welcomed by all as this will ensure diabetes never again
    &lt;/p&gt;

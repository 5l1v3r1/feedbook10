  <title>These Are Our Stories: Women&#39;s Stories of Abuse and Survival - Jan Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These Are Our Stories is a collection of women&#39;s stories, thoughts, and poems about the domestic abuse they have experienced throughout their lives. Transcribed directly from Jan Rosenberg&#39;s interviews with eleven women in the Florida panhandle, their histories embody the epidemic of domestic violence in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eleven survivors are lower to middle class women of various ethnic orientations, and range in age from their late twenties to mid-sixties. The survivors&#39; stories are clarified with the use of diagrams from The Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP), and examined as the women re-build their lives hours and days at a time. These Are Our Stories provides two resource guides following the women&#39;s interviews. The first guide is adapted for use in north Florida to assist an abused woman in identifying her situation using these eleven women&#39;s stories as a thread. The second resource is a brief bibliography of literature and resources for domestic violence victims that can be used throughout the U.S." />

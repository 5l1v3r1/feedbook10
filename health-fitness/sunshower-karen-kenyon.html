  <title>Sunshower - Karen Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunshower&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a journey through a human experiencesurviving the loss of a love by suicide, and the return of hope.  Much has been written about why someone would take his or her life, and about the prevention of suicide, but there is little recorded to throw light on what it is like to endure such a dramatic severing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunshower&lt;/i&gt; begins with a portrait of Karen and Dick Kenyon&#39;s early marriage, the birth of their son, Richard, the birth and death of a baby daughter, Johanna.  Then on November 3, 1978, Dick did not come home from work; instead, without warning, he took his own life.  The author charts her grief process, her awareness, her questions and turmoil, and her eventual path back to life and love.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunshower&lt;/i&gt; is a mystery story in the sense that life is a mystery.  It is told through the eyes of one person, but all our struggles and joys are somehow one.  We all love, we all lose.  Surviving after suicide is only a dramatic metaphor for survival of any kind.  Every day we live we are choosing life, creating life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Symbolically a sunshower is the union of sadness and joy, of rain clouds and of light.  The sunshowers of our lives are our releases and baptisms into new life.  This book, though it deals with and faces death, is most importantly about life and about love.  &lt;i&gt;Sunshower&lt;/i&gt; is the story of loss, but it is also a story of transformation and rebirth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Karen Kenyon has written a remarkably honest account in &lt;i&gt;SUNSHOWER&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;p&gt;In writing of a harrowing experience, she has avoided both self-pitying sentimentality and hidden angers.  It is a valuable -- if not priceless --addition to the literature of suicide. &lt;p&gt;                                                              Harold Greenwald, Ph.D. August 6, 1981 &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &quot;...we do a tremendous amount of suicide prevention work and I&#39;m sure your contribution in the form of this book will help many people.&quot; &lt;p&gt;  -- Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;SUNSHOWER&lt;/i&gt; has been recommended by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross to women who are in need of support--the ripple effect goes on, your gift of sharing and compassionate understanding.   &lt;p&gt; -- Janet Marlow for Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross" />

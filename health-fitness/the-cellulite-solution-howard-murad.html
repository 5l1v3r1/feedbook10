  <title>The Cellulite Solution - Howard Murad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Featuring the youth-building cellulite diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blast cellulite with a powerful, effective three-step program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every woman dreads it. But most women---even thin women---have it. Massage systems, topical creams, and going off caffeine won&#39;t budge cellulite, and dieting usually doesn&#39;t reduce it either. At last, &lt;i&gt;The Cellulite Solution&lt;/i&gt; contains a simple three-pronged program that actually works to reduce dimpling.&lt;br&gt;Drawing on thirty-five years of clinical experience, Dr. Murad has developed a cellulite-slaying method that is effective for woman of any age, no matter how severe their cellulite problem is. A triad of nutritional direction, lifestyle changes, and topical treatments combines to both prevent and get rid of cellulite.&lt;br&gt;Follow Dr. Murad&#39;s program and you&#39;ll see &quot;cottage cheese thighs&quot; reduced and you&#39;ll notice smoother skin all over as your cells are replenished and plumped by water. Dr. Murad explains his complete water principle and why cell hydration-which is essential to healthy and young-looking skin-can&#39;t come from drinking water alone. As a bonus, Dr. Murad&#39;s program also reduces stretch marks!&lt;br&gt;Complete with a detailed eating plan and specific recommendations for supplements as well as external skin care, &lt;i&gt;The Cellulite Solution&lt;/i&gt; is the magic formula you&#39;ve been looking for to banish the most stubborn beauty problem women face today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

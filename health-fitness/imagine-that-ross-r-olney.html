  <title>Imagine That!! - Ross R. Olney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The time is coming when we will all have the power to order cancer, or any other life-threatening disease, to just &quot;go away,&quot; and it will go away. In this book &quot;Ortho&quot; discusses it, and remarks about how backward we, here today, are. We can&#39;t even order a bad cold, let alone cancer, to go away. But then his buddy, &quot;Dontist&quot; points out that the cavemen were even worse off, and had to worry about becoming lunch for some hungry creature waiting outside their cave. The Music Man, with one of the most famous and enduring scams, might turn out to be prophetic according to many of today&#39;s experts on the subject. &quot;Professor&quot; Harold Hill thought he was using a great con on the gullible folks back in River City, Iowa, but in the mind of brilliant author/composer Meredith Willson, he was just doing what is in our own near future, and should work just fine. Hill&#39;s &quot;think system&quot; is now accepted by many imagery experts, and you can use this to better your own life. You can be a winner, all you must do is believe it." />

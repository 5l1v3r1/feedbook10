  <title>Deep Nutrition - Catherine M.D. Shanahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the Best Health and Wellness Books of 2017 -- &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A self-published phenomenon examining the habits that kept our ancestors disease-free--now with a prescriptive plan for &quot;The Human Diet&quot; to help us all live long, vital, healthy lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physician and biochemist Cate Shanahan, M.D. examined diets around the world known to help people live longer, healthier lives--diets like the Mediterranean, Okinawa, and &quot;Blue Zone&quot;--and identified the four common nutritional habits, developed over millennia, that unfailingly produce strong, healthy, intelligent children, and active, vital elders, generation after generation. These four nutritional strategies--fresh food, fermented and sprouted foods, meat cooked on the bone, and organ meats--form the basis of what Dr. Cate calls &quot;The Human Diet.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rooted in her experience as an elite athlete who used traditional foods to cure her own debilitating injuries, and combining her research with the latest discoveries in the field of epigenetics, Dr. Cate shows how all calories are not created equal; food is information that directs our cellular growth. Our family history does not determine our destiny: what you eat and how you live can alter your DNA in ways that affect your health and the health of your future children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deep Nutrition&lt;/i&gt; offers a prescriptive plan for how anyone can begin eating The Human Diet to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Improve mood&lt;br&gt;*Eliminate cravings and the need to snack&lt;br&gt;*Boost fertility and have healthier children&lt;br&gt;*Sharpen cognition and memory&lt;br&gt;*Eliminate allergies and disease&lt;br&gt;*Build stronger bones and joints&lt;br&gt;*Get younger, smoother skin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deep Nutrition&lt;/i&gt; cuts through today&#39;s culture of conflicting nutritional ideologies, showing how the habits of our ancestors can help us lead longer, healthier, more vital lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />

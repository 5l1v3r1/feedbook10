  <title>The Food of Gods - Divine Nutrition - Jasmuheen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Food of Gods is Jasmuheen&#39;s 18th book on metaphysical matters and her third book in the Divine Nutrition series. It is not necessary to have read the previous books on this subject which cover her personal journey and the solution for world health and world hunger issues as &quot;The Foods of Gods&quot; takes the pranic nourishment discussion to another level and offers simple yet powerful tools to satiate all of our hungers.  	Jasmuheen writes: The most important difference with our focus with Divine Nutrition is that It has the ability to feed us on all levels and that we can still benefit from increasing Its flow through our bio-system even if we continue to choose to enjoy eating. Allowing this Divinely Nutritional stream to be increased in our system means that we can be fed emotionally, mentally and spiritually and as such the techniques and guidelines shared in this book, will benefit us all by freeing us from our current personal and global emotional, mental and spiritual states of anorexia." />

  <title>Where Did You Go? - Christina Rasmussen</title>

A young widow with two daughters, Rasmussen would go on to become an esteemed grief educator who helped countless others rebuild their lives after loss. Yet, even as she learned to thrive again, that first heartbreaking question persisted. Even as she and her clients forged new paths and discovered new joy, the same questions remained: Are we capable of connecting to those who have passed on? What really happens after we die?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a professional grounded in science, Christina was a skeptic who shied away from the conventional mystical, supernatural, and religious descriptions of the afterlife&amp;#8212;so she turned to what seemed &amp;#8220;provable&amp;#8221; to unravel the mystery of life beyond life: physics. What she found was beyond anything she could have expected: not only is there life after death, but we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have the ability to connect with loved ones who have passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing an inspiring message of hope, optimism, and love, &lt;em&gt;Where Did You Go?&lt;/em&gt; is a transporting step-by-step guide to journeying to the other side, from one of our most trusted voices on life after loss. Bridging the gap between the metaphysical and the measurable, it will change the way we grieve, the way we live and how we define our potential&amp;#8212;in this life and the hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Sexi Juicing - Dr. Etti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SEXi Juicing: Reset your body, mind and spirit
Dr Etti has been teaching a seven-day body cleansing program - better known around town as SEXi Juicing - for 15 years. Dr Etti has created a practical and authentic adaptation of juice fasting using ancient purification and weight management techniques that are fun and easy to implement in our modern day lives.
SEXi juicing is not a diet. Its a guided juice cleansing that helps you shift to a healthier way of living. It utilizes modalities of the body, mind and spirit which have never before been integrated into a simple program to support a fundamental life style shift. It has transformed many peoples lives.
For the first time ever, Dr. Etti makes the SEXi juicing program available to the general public. This book is an easy-to-follow, do-it-yourself edition of Dr. Ettis program, so readers can tap into the same exclusive formulas she has perfected, from the comfort and privacy of their homes. The book guides readers through the program with day-to-day interactions and provides them with shopping lists, recipes, post-juicing meal plans, cleansing tips, and a wealth of holistic nutritional information.
You, the reader, will learn how simple and fun a body cleanse can be and find yourself quite surprise that SEXi Juicing can help you achieve so much more beyond just cleansing your body.
SEXi Juicing is perfect for anyone looking to press the resent button and return to their purified body and sensual self." />

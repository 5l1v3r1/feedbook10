  <title>The Red Grocery Bag - David Abidaoud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every morning, on the way to the park, a little boy and his grandmother
passed a big gray building with large windows. It was always a very
noisy and busy place. He knew that the place was a factory, and every
time he passed it, he wanted to ask his grandmother what the people
inside were making. But every time he was walking by, the loud noises
coming from inside scared him and made him walk or even run away.
He always forgot to ask his question. But that morning, it was unusually
quiet. There were a few people outside; it looked like they were getting
ready to do something important. Then the boy remembered what he
always wanted to ask his grandmother, What were the people inside
making? His grandmother stopped and said, I think its a good time
for you to look inside." />

      <meta name="description" content="S.O.S Sink or Swim is about Hannah and her struggle how to start over in a new country after escaping a lifetime of domestic violence. Hannahs journey began in her family-home back in Sweden and her first book Damned if I Do, Dead if I Dont telling the story of years of terror. When Hannah finally finds the strengths to leave her fianc and the horrible abuse to save her life, she thought to herself Im just going to erase my past and start over. But Hannah realized quickly that life doesnt work that way. The lies she had heard, the punches and kicks Hannah had received her whole life, had gone deep down and wounded her soul so bad. She had to start from the beginning, not just with money, job and somewhere to live, but with everything. Hannah had to learn to trust herself, to trust others enough to ask for help, to be able to build a new life. But most important, Hannah had to find herself again, find that strong woman she knew she really was. It was harder than Hannah could ever imagine but she knew there were only two choices, Sink Or Swim." />

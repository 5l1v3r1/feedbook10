  <title>Eat to Save Your Life - Gloria Askew Rrn, Jerre Paquette PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The food and supplements industries are complex, political, and fraught with debate. Most people are uncertain and uninformed about what constitutes the best nutrition and often make decisions that put their lives at risk. Eat to Save Your Life intends to help you make the best decisions by providing you with the best science-based nutritional information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you might not know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many life-threatening diseases are on the increase, and new diseases are emerging that pharmaceuticals alone are not addressing: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and other common disorders have been linked to nutritional deficiencies. Yet licensing regulations may prevent or discourage your physician from advising about nutrition and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm yourself with contemporary knowledge and penetrating questions as you search for the best food and food supplements for you and your family. This book will help you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloria and Jerre have successfully created a handbook that simplifies the essentials of proper nutrition and supplementation from the piles of information and misinformation that is out there. Its a fantastic reference for anyone looking to improve their health while saving time and money at the health food store.&lt;/p&gt;

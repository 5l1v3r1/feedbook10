  <title>Rationalizing the Thoughts of a Woman - Clara D. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines the actions that we as women take in matters concerning our love, sex and attraction for a man as well as our communication with our children. It addresses women in the mist of abuse and how delicate the situation has to be dealt with. Abuse doesnt stop at the point of escape. The verbal remarks and physical abuse create lifelong scars and constant struggle. This book simply breaks down the thought pattern and expectations we often have when entering or operating in a relationship. I dont assume to know the answers Im just analyzing my steps and trying to correct my own actions during this process. I want to open womens mind and make them think before acting. Maybe its because for generations we were breed only to sexually satisfy, physically attract and economically support men. Is there a generational curse on us?" />

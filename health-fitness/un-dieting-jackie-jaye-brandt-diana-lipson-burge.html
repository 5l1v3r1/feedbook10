  <title>Un-Dieting - Jackie Jaye-Brandt, Diana Lipson-Burge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Un-Dieting was born out of a lifetime of failed diets, addiction to food and drugs, frustration over not having the body we always wanted to have and years of experience working with eating disorders. After years of dieting, we finally learned that diets were the very thing keeping our weight on! Instinctively, we knew this must be true, because we finally were beginning to see that all the weight we lost from diets was regained sooner or later. 
This book will teach you that the main reason we eat excess calories is due to excess hunger, which is direct result of diets and deprivation. Then we will show you why and how we eat our emotions, rather than expressing them. And most important, you will receive tools: tools for eliminating anger and resentment; tools for transforming fear and worry; and tools for communicating your wants and needs, so that you no longer have to eat your feelings. Lastly, you will notice that when you have self-esteem or confidence, you feel better, you perform better, you communicate better, your relationships are better, and your ability to lose excess weight is greatly enhanced. So, because self esteem goes hand in hand with success in every area of your life, you will receive 20 keys for raising self-esteem on a daily basis." />

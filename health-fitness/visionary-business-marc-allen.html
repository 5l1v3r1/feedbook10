  <title>Visionary Business - Marc Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A powerful book presenting the 12 keys of business success and the 25 principles and practices of visionary business
This transformative book has helped people all over the world to not only envision and create success but also build a truly visionary business: one that supports its employees, the community, and the environment.
We meet Marc Allen’s mentor Bernie, an unforgettable character who teaches Marc the ways of ethical and socially responsible business. Together they turn Marc’s fledgling attempts at business into a thriving corporate success, founded on diverse principles of positive psychology, Eastern and Western spirituality, market savvy, and simple kindness.
Marc finds that it’s all too easy to fall prey to anxieties and negative beliefs when you set out to create your own business, especially if you are learning the details as you go. Fortunately, Bernie shows Marc the most important thing of all: how to transform his thinking and change his old beliefs. This essential inner work is one of the great keys Bernie gives Marc. Step by step, Marc learns everything necessary to create the business of his dreams." />

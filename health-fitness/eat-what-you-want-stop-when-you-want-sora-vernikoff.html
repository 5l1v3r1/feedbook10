As a result of this, your diet &lt;em&gt;keeps you consistently feeling deprived&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s why you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself &amp;nbsp;either diet &amp;ldquo;bingeing&amp;rdquo; or diet &amp;ldquo;overeating&amp;rdquo; (depending on what you call it) &lt;em&gt;to always get more of the&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;food &lt;strong&gt;that you &amp;ldquo;really&amp;rdquo; want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Then after you diet &amp;ldquo;binge&amp;rdquo; or diet &amp;ldquo;overeat&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;you feel terrible&lt;/em&gt;, beat yourself up for not being able to stay on your diet and then you feel that you have no choice but to return to your diet if you&amp;rsquo;re truly hopeful of becoming thinner and healthier!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But diets don&amp;rsquo;t work!&amp;nbsp; Diets don&amp;rsquo;t work because they&amp;rsquo;re not your rules!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Sora&amp;rsquo;s Weight Loss &amp;ldquo;Management&amp;rdquo; Program as taught in a fun workbook format teaches you two simple eat and stop yourself techniques which are named The &amp;ldquo;Green&amp;rdquo; Technique and The &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo; Technique. The way that The &amp;ldquo;Green&amp;rdquo; Technique works is that it lets you have the food that you want but before you can eat that food, you have to ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;How much is enough?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How much is too much?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Then once you&amp;rsquo;ve decided &amp;ldquo;How much is enough?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How much is too much?&amp;rdquo;,&amp;nbsp; you have to set aside the amount that you decided was &amp;ldquo;too&amp;rdquo; much called your &amp;ldquo;Too&amp;rdquo; Much Marker.&amp;nbsp; Then you can eat the amount that you decided was enough and by Program definition (as long as you can see your &amp;ldquo;Too&amp;rdquo; Much Marker) you will know that you have eaten and stopped yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now The &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo; Technique works in a similar way to also let you eat and stop yourself but is different in the way that the actual technique works with the actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that by now using The &amp;ldquo;Green&amp;rdquo; Technique and/or The &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo; Technique &lt;em&gt;you will always be able to eat what you want, stop when you want and become forever thin and healthy&lt;strong&gt; and yes, all without having to diet!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the program also teaches you how to use three exciting no diet, weight-loss &amp;ldquo;management&amp;rdquo; strategies. These three additional no diet, weight-loss &amp;ldquo;management&amp;rdquo; strategies help to support you in reaching your no dieted, weight-loss goal &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the very shortest amount of time possible! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why stay an unhappy dieter managed by deprivation, potential diet &amp;ldquo;overeating&amp;rdquo; or diet &amp;ldquo;bingeing&amp;rdquo; with the likelihood of you regaining your weight once you&amp;rsquo;ve reached your weight-loss goal &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when now you can eat what you want, stop when you want, and become forever thin and healthy and yes, all without having to diet! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you deserve that choice &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Truth That Tears Us Apart; the Lies That Keep Us Together - Kenneth KennyTalk DeMoss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most common thing we hear in relationships is that the problem is, no one wants to truthfully communicate. We hear that this is the reason that relationships dont work out. But after reading the truth that I will communicate in this book, you will see that its actually the opposite. I bring to you, The truth that tears us apart. Im sure you can relate when I say that telling a lie has never broke up a relationship, its the truth that really causes it. The truth is still bitter to swallow and many of cant deal with it. I wanted to take you on a small journey through situations that I have encountered growing up. The #RelationshipTRuth is what I am going to tell from my perspective, a perspective that has been shaped and molded by a life of dealing with women from all walks of life. I will expose the biggest reason why we cant all just get along, and what we need to do in order to be happy in our love lives. I bring to you the beginning of a philosophy that I call the #RelationshipTRuth, from a forum or brand that I call the Kennytalkexperience. Visit my video blog site at kennytalkexperience.com where I deliver the #RelationshipTRuth quotes weekly, and follow on twitter @kennytalkexp for daily quotes that I send out. Read with an open and prepare to be entertained." />

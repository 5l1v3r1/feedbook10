  <title>Transforming Grief Through the Elements - Melody Ruth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When her parents both died suddenly and within a few days of each other, Melody experienced a tremendous amount of grief. After having a spiritual experience, she began to focus on utilizing aspects of nature to assist her in processing her emotions. In walking through the journey of grief-related emotions, she was able to find new perspectives on living life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Transforming Grief Through The Elements, Melody shares the methods she used to work through many challenging emotions.&amp;nbsp; She also explains the stages of grief as Shock or Disbelief, Unpredictable Emotions, Looking Back, Forgiveness and Spiritual Acceptance/Pointing forward. A suppressed&amp;nbsp;grief that is unmanaged can impact life in a negative way, however, working through grief yields personal growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming Grief Through The Elements provides information on utilizing tools rooted in the four main elements of nature (earth,&amp;nbsp;air, fire, and water), which are accessible to everyone to facilitate the processing of emotions and evaluating life lessons. When mourning over the loss of life is entirely processed, peace and even more significant happiness than before can be attained. Dealing with death and loss with thorough examination can help bring forth a new appreciation for our own humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming Grief Through The Elements includes meditative exercises that will help you attain personal insights, which assist&amp;nbsp;in overcoming the intensity of grief and also utilize the experience to embrace life more fully than before. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>It&#39;s Not about the Food - Tracy Baines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Not about the Food is part memoir, part practical self-help book for parents whose child has an eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many books on eating disorders from the sufferer&amp;#39;s point of view but very few written for parents of children or young adults. Those that are on the market are written by health professionals or counsellors/therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When Tracy Baines discovered her daughter had an eating disorder she was paralysed with fear. When finally galvanised into action and having secured help, she was left in the dark. Her daughter was over 18 and so she was not included in her treatment plan. Although she went with her to every clinic appointment she was totally unaware of what went on behind closed doors. She had to muddle along on her own, trying to support her daughter and help her husband and son understand something that she didn&amp;rsquo;t understand herself. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want her family to fall apart. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to fall apart. &amp;nbsp;This book redresses that lack of support and insight. She is not a professional but she is an expert in looking after someone with an eating disorder and helping them on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>51 Meal Recipes for the Pregnant Mother: Smart Nutrition and Proper Dieting Solutions for the Expecting Mom - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most beautiful experiences in a woman&#39;s life is pregnancy. An opportunity to create another life is one of the greatest gifts.However, planning a pregnancy or being pregnant includes preparing for ahealthier lifestyle. A proper diet during pregnancy is extremely important for the baby&#39;s development and growth. A perfect balance of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients is the key to proper nutrition before, during, and after pregnancy. Based on my personal research, I have created a book that includesacollection of recipes containing all important nutrients taken out of everyday foods that are crucial not only for pregnancy but to overall health. I want these recipes to serve as an idea of what a proper diet for a pregnant woman should look like. Protein, calcium, iron, and folic acid are some of the most important nutrients you should be consuming." />

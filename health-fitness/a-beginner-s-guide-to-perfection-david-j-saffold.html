  <title>A Beginner’S Guide to Perfection - David J. Saffold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your new life starts now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often we want to make our lives different, but we dont know where to start--or, if we do start, we end up where we first began. Why cant we make the life changes we want to make? Why do we keep sabotaging our dreams? And why do we think we dont deserve a better life? The answer to these problems is simple; we must change our relationship with ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A Beginners Guide to Perfection, life coach David J. Saffold shows you how to change your relationship with yourself and come to accept all of yourself, even the parts you dislike. When youre able to accept yourself, your entire life opens upand what used to seem impossible becomes your reality. Your life starts filling with purpose and meaning; you become decisive, confident, and powerful. As you bring a new creativity to all you do, you begin to reach higher levels of prosperity and accept and express more love. And intractable problems melt away as if by magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Beginners Guide to Perfection gives you everything you need to succeed in making your life what you want it to be. Why wait? The time to start is now!&lt;/p&gt;" />

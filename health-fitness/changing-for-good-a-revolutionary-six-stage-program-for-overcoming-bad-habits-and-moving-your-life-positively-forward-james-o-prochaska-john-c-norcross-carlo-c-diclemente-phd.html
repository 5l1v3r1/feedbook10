  <title>Changing for Good: A Revolutionary Six-Stage Program for Overcoming Bad Habits and Moving Your Life Positively Forward - James O. Prochaska, John C. Norcross, Carlo C. DiClemente, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times have you thought about starting a diet or quitting smoking without doing anything about it? Or lapsed back into bad habits after hitting a rough spot on the road to recovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover the secret to successful personal change, three acclaimed psychologists studied more than 1,000 people who were able to positively and permanently alter their lives without psychotherapy.  They discovered that change does not depend on luck or willpower.  It is a process that can be successfully managed by anyone who understands how it works.  Once you determine which stage of change you&amp;#8217;re in, you can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a climate where positive change can occur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;maintain motivation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;turn setbacks into progress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make your new benefifificial habits a permanent part of your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking book offers simple self-assessments, informative case histories, and concrete examples to help clarify each stage and process.  Whether your goal is to start saving money, to stop drinking, or to end other self-defeating or addictive behaviors, this revolutionary program will help you implement positive personal change . . . for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Cancer Institute Found this program more than twice as effective as standard programs in helping smokers quit for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;" />

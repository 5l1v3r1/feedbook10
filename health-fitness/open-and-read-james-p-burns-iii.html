      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Open and Read&quot; is a sincere collection of 101 poetic rules to help empower the reader to find meaning in their lives while growing through adversity and difficult times.  &quot;This book is merely encouragement, Guidance and direction, A collection of ideas, Intended for thoughtful reflection, With a purpose so simple, A message to &quot;Open and Read,&quot; When the day becomes difficult, Recite this dreamer&#39;s creed.  If you&#39;re willing to set sail, The sea will push you around, The day will turn dark, While the waves break you down, Beaten and bruised, You must remain on course, The storm will run out of rain, And the wind will calm its source.  When you finally reach land, You&#39;ll know it was worth it to explore, Because the fear you felt at sea, Becomes the courage you take ashore, Remember adversity gives life color, Every challenge plays its part, Our experiences are like brush strokes, In life&#39;s grand work of art.&quot;" />

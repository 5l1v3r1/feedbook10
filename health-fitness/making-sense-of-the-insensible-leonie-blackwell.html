  <title>Making Sense of the Insensible - Leonie Blackwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you read every self-development book on the market? Are you looking for a book to talk to you about the reality of the ups and downs of life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonie Blackwell explores ten injustices that can occur in our childhood, our adulthood or throughout our lives as recurring themes. They are often the events we spend a lifetime trying to make sense of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons of injustice come to us in three wayshow we treat others, how others treat us and how we treat ourselves. Regardless of the source of the experience, the goal is to embark on the journey of transformation and empowerment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The injustices serve as a terrific checklist for those who have done much inner work and may need to tweak here and there or as beautiful stepping stones to line up as you commence your journey of deep reflection. Either way they allow us to see ourselves less as victims and more as students of life with lessons we havent learnt yet. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Baggage Claim - Michael J.D. Lowery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the greatest metaphors to relationships and all of their nuances is flying; the entire flight experience from start to finish. From the planning and packing stages to departing and eventually deplaning, air travel intimates and imitates life&amp;#39;s greatest enigma; relationships. No better depiction of this conundrum than the Baggage Claim area, with its overcrowded carousels fraught with luggage and people of all colors, shapes, and sizes. It is here where the theme of this book resonates with efficacy; carefully and artfully interweaving the main passenger&amp;#39;s plight within his flight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is this nebulous journey that takes center stage within this book. Baggage Claim becomes more than a designated area within an airport. It becomes an emotional and psychological malaise that disrupts healthy and wholesome relationships, and threatens to leave the most important passenger stranded at the &amp;quot;arrival&amp;quot; terminal of life; a new and better YOU!" />

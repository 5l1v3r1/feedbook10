  <title>If Your Mountain Won&#39;t Move, Climb It! - Annette Whitmire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus said in Mark 11:23, If anyone says to this mountain, Go, throw yourself into the sea, and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. My five year old grandson asked, How does God move mountains? Arent they really heavy? They sure are and He sure can! But what if your mountain will not move, or even budge? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope for the next few chapters I can walk along side of you as you climb your mountain, by sharing with you bits and pieces of my own personal experiences, difficulties, and accomplishments. A friend of mine once said, We tend to look at mountains as a bad thing that Jesus has to cast into the sea, but sometimes those mountains are not troubles in our lives but triumphs! Sometimes God does not move the mountain but calls us to climb it and conquer it. So gather your supplies, and get on your hiking shoes, and lets go mountain climbing!&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When he was just a kid, author James A. Harrell Jr.s parents divorced. As a youngster, he couldnt understand why his father never came to see him or his brothers or provide sustenance for their well-being. Harrell spent many sleepless and tearful nights longing for his father. That pain became even more apparent when his father died in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the writings included in A Real Man Stands Tall, Harrell attempts to come to grips with this abandonment. He intimately shares what his life was like, and he offers scriptural-based testimony on the important role a father plays in the rearing of his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blend of fiction and nonfiction, Harrell offers poetry, narrative, and a collection of interviews to underscore a mans responsibility to his family by spending quality timedepositing wisdom, knowledge, instruction, and understanding into their hearts. A Real Man Stands Tall encourages males to become better men, better husbands, and better fathers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

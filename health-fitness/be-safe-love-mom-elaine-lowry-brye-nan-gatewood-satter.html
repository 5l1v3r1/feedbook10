  <title>Be Safe, Love Mom - Elaine Lowry Brye, Nan Gatewood Satter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;This essential guide for all military families provides helpful advice and reassurance on topics ranging from boot camp, to deployment, to PTSD, from a former &quot;Army brat&quot; turned mother of four military kids.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;When you enlist in the United States military, you don&#39;t just sign up for duty; you also commit your loved ones to lives of service all their own.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;No one knows this better than Elaine Brye, an &quot;Army brat&quot; turned military wife and the mother of four officers-one each in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. For more than a decade she&#39;s endured countless teary goodbyes, empty chairs at Thanksgiving dinners, and sleepless hours waiting for phone calls in the night. She&#39;s navigated the complicated tangle of emotions that are part and parcel of life as a military mother.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;i  &gt;Be Safe, Love Mom&lt;/i&gt; braids together Elaine&#39;s own personal experiences with those of fellow parents she&#39;s met along the way. She offers gentle guidance and hard-earned wisdom on topics ranging from that first anxious goodbye to surrendering all control of your child, from finding comfort in the support of the military community and the healing power of faith to coping with the enormous sacrifices life as a military mother requires.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;With hard-to-come-by information and encouragement that is like advice from a wise and trusted friend, &lt;i  &gt;Be Safe, Love Mom&lt;/i&gt; is an essential handbook to membership in a strong and special sisterhood.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Love Centered Parenting - Dr. Pina LoGiudice, Maria Gavriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our modern culture has lowered the volume on our inner voice. We, as parents, are often left disempowered and unclear about our parenting choices. What exactly has been muffling that inner voice, and where do we go from here?
Love Centered Parenting offers friendly guidance to help you find your own inner wisdom, so that you hear it loudly and clearly during your parenting journey. It is an intimate share about fertility challenges, pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, sleep issues, diet, natural healing, and healthy choicesencouraging you to tune into your own intuition, while reaching out to community to support you. As you read through this book, you will be reminded to tap into your innate intelligence so that you are left feeling empowered with your conscious parenting choices.
The book is both a personal story and an insightful journey into holistic living and parenting. Perhaps the most powerful thread weaving through both Marias personal story and her advice on traveling a holistic path, is the message that women must rediscover their mothering intuition and learn to trust their gut instincts. Listening to ones inner voice is one of the greatest skills any parent can cultivate, whether they choose to follow holistic parenting, or a more conventional route.
 Nancy Peplinsky, founder and executive director, Holistic Moms Network
Marias path of discovery has achieved something very rare and precious.  That she has been willing to share her wisdom with us is a priceless gift.
 Kim John Payne, M.Ed., author of Simplicity Parenting, Beyond Winning, 
and The Soul of Discipline. 
This book reflects the intuitive and practical experiences of Maria on her path of conscious parenting. Through her experiences, readers are able to expand their awareness for their own journey as well. Kudos, Maria for an authentic, insightful book.

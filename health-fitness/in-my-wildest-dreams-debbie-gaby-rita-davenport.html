  <title>In My Wildest Dreams? - Debbie Gaby, Rita Davenport</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;A Bouquet Starts with Seeds of Hope and Inspiration&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Debbie Gaby&amp;#8217;s choices led her down an amazing road, from rural Texas to entrepreneurship and corporate boardrooms, and, finally, to a life that&amp;#8217;s centered around philanthropy and giving back to those who face challenges and choices as daunting as those she faced decades ago.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;In My Wildest Dreams... &lt;/I&gt; she reflects on a lifetime of choices and the opportunities they gave her to learn and grow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like many people, Debbie life has been filled with choices. Each of us, every day, makes dozens of choices &amp;#151; some inconsequential, others life-changing. Some we&amp;#8217;d make again, in a heartbeat. Others, given the clarity of hindsight, we might have handled very differently. In &lt;I&gt;In My Wildest Dreams... &lt;/I&gt;, Debbie looks at a lifetime of choices and the opportunities they gave her to learn and grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With humor, compassion, love, and refreshing doses of Southern charm, Debbie Gaby &amp;#151; America&amp;#8217;s Queen of Sleep and Big Dreams &amp;#151; shares the stories of her life that have shaped, challenged, and inspired her to become the woman she is today. Readers will find &lt;I&gt;In My Wildest Dreams...&lt;/I&gt; joyful, uplifting and inspiring&amp;#151;and a testimony that the gifts in our lives come to us in interesting and often awe-inspiring ways... different shapes and colors and scents, one more beautiful than the next.&lt;/div&gt;" />

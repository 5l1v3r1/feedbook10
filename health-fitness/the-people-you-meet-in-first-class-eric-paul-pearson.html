  <title>The People You Meet in First Class - Eric Paul Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The People You meet in First Class is a compilation of over forty years as an airline traveler in both Coach and First Class beginning in 1974. The stories provide unembellished&amp;nbsp;observations in the airport and on the plane as well as some insight into deep conversations that occurred between the author and other travelers and airline employees. Through observation and a willingness to engage with total strangers, Eric Pearson experience unexpected conversations, insights into the lives and troubles of perfect strangers and often shared ideas and solutions creating life changing conversations. Eric is a motivational speaker and storyteller who magically brings to life these conversations such that the reader feels they are sitting in the plane listening to the conversations. The stories are funny, interesting, some quite deep and Eric is careful to keep the tome as lighthearted as possible as he shares his thoughts and experiences. &amp;nbsp;As the airline industry changed over the years, the stories and the people remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;" />

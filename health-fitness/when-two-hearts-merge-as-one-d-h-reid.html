  <title>When Two Hearts Merge As One - D.H. REID</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the dawn of history, individuals have been attracted to each other and they seek that one person that makes them feel happy, fulfilled, and special in their lives. Nothing is easy through their constant search for true love, romance, intimacy, and it takes dating, chemistry, and finding those that are compatible to find the one that makes us smile, they touch our souls in a special way, or they want to spend the rest of their lives together. Join a young man on his quest for true love and the trials he faces through rejection, mistakes made and having to experience the bitter to appreciate the sweet. Sometimes it requires a lifetime in their search for the one that explodes fireworks over their head, their palms sweat, they are weak in the knees in their presence, and once that love is found, they treasure and hold onto it for the rest of their lives. There is someone for everyone and even though it leads to frustration, heartache, the pain of losing someone that is special, we persevere in faith." />

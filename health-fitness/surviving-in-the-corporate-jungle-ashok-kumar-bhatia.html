  <title>Surviving in the Corporate Jungle - Ashok Kumar Bhatia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The corporate jungle is full of lion-like bosses whose roar could chill your nerves of steel from a distance. It is also inhabited by lionesses who might take you under their wings and protect you from many a catastrophe, much like they would protect a cub of theirs. 
This book is a compilation of tactics you can use to not only survive but also do well in the corporate jungle. It is intended to amuse, entertain, and educate. It is a lighthearted take on the art and science of management, from the jaundiced perspective of someone who is still learning it! 
It offers quite a few gems of wisdom meant for managers and entrepreneurs of all hues, sizes, and shapes. They could be the aspiring kind, the practicing and tired kind, or the retired kind. 
Glum chief executive officers, hassled by the harsh slings and arrows of managing a business, might get motivated to look at the sunnier side of life upon leafing through some of its contents. 
Nail-biting aspiring managers may understand how to successfully navigate their way through the corporate jungle. They might also get prompted to develop an inner compass based on personal values, leading to better levels of satisfaction, happiness and fulfillment." />

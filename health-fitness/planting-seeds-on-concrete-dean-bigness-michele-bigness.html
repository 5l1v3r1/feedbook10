  <title>Planting Seeds on Concrete - Dean Bigness, Michele Bigness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Letters from God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnessing Humanity in New Definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachings provided to adapt and evolve as we enter new cycles of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planting Seeds on Concrete is a collection of rich, complex narratives with God; to understand who we are and to know Him in the modern definition. He asks for something, in return; have an open mind, have faith and for the faithful to know the difference. The following was given to help explain the messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is not a MY GOD or YOUR GOD book. The words are GODs and to know, when you hear HIM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words that provoke fear or doom, are the words of men; translations distilled in the mindset of their heart, not the pure words, from particular moments of time. These letters are the seeds of, and for ALL time, ALL MINDS and SOULS. My purpose is twofold:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
1) Prevent destruction that man will succeed, if, man remains focused on greed to take or compromise from the natural resources of MY EARTH, I gave as a gift for the World. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) For My children. I LOVE ALL of MY CREATIONS and have provided My wisdom as a gesture of love, for you to remember Me, as when you are in the spiritual and introduce to you My true definition, when you are in physical form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find My words to cleanse the soul from; pain or greed to overpower others, grief given or received and love with conditions, when there are not. Remove your masks of illusion to hide intensions of your truer nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When All masks are freed, the heart and voice align and you will know Me. Let me teach you how. God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Discover the magic each and every life offers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Sacred Work of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren - Elaine K. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are not alone if you are one of the staggering numbers of grandparents who are raising their grandchildren! Are you confused by the generational gaps, challenging communications, and tough questions like, Why are my parents so old? Why is my father in jail? Why doesnt my mother show up to visit when she promised? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sacred Work of Grandparents Raising Their Grandchildren&lt;/i&gt; is the first book that contains answers and stories to address these unique issues and challengesfrom one grandparent to another. Youll enjoy the practical suggestions on how grandchildren can manage and solve some of their own problems, while learning how to cope with your own distinctive life challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parenting grandparent, a kinship caregiver, a teacher, or a social service worker, you must read this book for invaluable insight. No other book takes on the complex challenges that parenting grandparents face with such depth and truth. How relieved and grateful youll be for the inspiration, knowledge and wisdom by the time you reach the conclusion! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Through the stories told by grandparents themselves, Elaine K. Williams reveals the challenges, commitment, and love experienced by grandparents raising their grandchildren. This book not only provides understanding and helpful information, but will also touch the hearts of all who read it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy P., a grandparent who raised a grandchild&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ive waited five years for this wonderful author, Elaine K. Williams, to complete her groundbreaking gathering of knowledge from three generations so that we can clearly see the patterns of grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. The most important points are to help grandparents understand the dynamics of the emotional and behavioral challenges their grandchildren face, and the impactful trauma that all generations experience. She brings the keys of caring, connection, and communication forward to assist families to heal. Highly recommended.  &lt;/p&gt;

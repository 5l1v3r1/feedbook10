  <title>Coping with Illness Through Attitude and Faith - Robert Licciardello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coping with Illness Through Attitude and Faith is a true story. It shares how important
lessons from life and his military career where invaluable in helping Robert overcome the
most difficult time in his life. As a healthy father, businessman and normal human being,
Robert never thought the time would come when he would be calling on these lessons to
help carry him further through life. While in the military many of his units missions where
humanitarian missions, which he considered to be the most rewarding of all his service.
Robert had no way of knowing that all the unselfish aid, kindness and compassion shown
for those less fortunate would one day be extended to him.
In October of 2004, Robert was afflicted with a rare disease called Dermatomyositis.
After being admitted to the hospital on October 6, 2004 Robert quickly lost all the use of
his muscles becoming totally incapable of taking care of all this human needs. Roberts
book called Coping with Illness through Attitude and Faith, My Story, makes the reader
aware that there are some of lifes challenges that we may not have any control over. The
author tells about the wall he faced when the doctor told him that he may, or may never,
walk again. Robert explains how he took mental control in preparing for either outcome. The
reader is made aware of how many situations in life may not change, but how you handle
them, is completely under your control. The reader is also reminded that the one thing we
have total control over, is our attitude. As one of his mentors said, when you ask yourself
what am I going to do now? You are going to bounce back as if you had a rubber bottom.
The author felt by writing Coping with Illness through Attitude and Faith he might be able
to prepare others to accept and overcome some of lifes most extreme challenges." />

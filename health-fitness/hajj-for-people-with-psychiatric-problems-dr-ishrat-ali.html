  <title>Hajj for People with Psychiatric Problems - Dr. Ishrat Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My early education and schooling was in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Later on I graduated in Medicine from King Edwards Medical University Lahore Pakistan and did Internship in Mayo Hospital, Lahore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I did my Post-graduate Training in Psychiatry partly in Canada and partly in U.K.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Canada I worked in Kingston, Ontario. In U.K. I worked as Registrar later as Senior Registrar in Bridgend (Wales), Doncaster and Glasgow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I came to Australia in 1981. Since then I have worked in Bloomfield Hospital, Orange, Long Bay Hospital and Bankstown Hospital in Sydney as Consultant Psychiatrist doing private practice as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Currently I am in private practice and also a conjoint Lecturer in Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My interests are in General and Forensic Psychiatry. I also meet workers of Indian, Pakistani and middle-eastren Religious and Social organisations. My main aim is to identify wrong attitudes to mentally ill and modify them with advice. I have found that these attitudes are the result of lack of understanding and I have seen them changing as a result of advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

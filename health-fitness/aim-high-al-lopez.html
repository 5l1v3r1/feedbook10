  <title>Aim High - Al Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description
Since the beginning of mankind, there have always been individuals who start life with disadvantages but by sighting their Aim High above mediocrity they have accomplished great things!
I chose the title Aim High for this book as an analogy to impress upon the readers that regardless of their beginnings by sighting their Aim High they can go on to be the best that they can be at whatever they want.
The key to success is first to develop a desire for something.  What do you want out of life? Once a desire is instilled within, motivation follows, and then you must write out a well thought out plan of action on how to do what you want to achieve then you must follow through with action.  I believe we all have a purpose in life. The hard part is to find out what that something is.
What is your purpose? The soul that has not established aim loses itself. 
Montaigne (15331592) 
 In the book Aim High I have done my best to present in sixteen steps guidance and stimulus for success.
Success does not happen immediately. Achieving success happens by having a series of successes. The first successes are small, but as you move up one step at a time, you will move up to accomplish higher and higher achievements.
Aim High is a self-help book about self- improvement. I have written the sixteen-step aim high path to personal achievementstudy guide in a way that I hope will help all who read it improve the quality of their lives.
We go through life making choices. We have the capacity to direct our destiny by the choices we make 
In the Aim High book I have presented sixteen points I call steps: Effort, Example, Enthusiasm, Spiritual, Physical, Personal, Encouragement, Personality, Financial, Career, Looks, Speak, Purpose, Plan, Belief, Action. 
These sixteen points provide guidance and serve as a stimulus for success through self-motivation. It is the awaking of the inner self to the potential that can be realized. 
In order to reach your highest and fullest potential, you must first have the courage to think, to imagine, to dream.
Dream! What do you want for yourself out of life? What do you desire?  
The definition of desire in (thesaurus) is synonyms with hunger, craving, longing, and yearning. Desire will stoke your self-motivation to do!
Your first priority is to decide and establish what you desire as your goal.
Goal setting is the single most important ingredient in self-motivation that leads to achieving success. Your next priority is to write out a specific plan of action about how you are going to achieve your goal, and you should know why you want you desire it. Then go after your goal with passion, a burning desire within you. To do it!
My grandson Ryan invited me to go to the movie, The Empire Strikes Back. I was impressed with what the Jedi teacher teaches his student about engaging the force that is the greatest power in the universe. He tells his student that there is no try, that there is either do or not do.
Another important ingredient necessary to achieve success is self-confidence. Self-confidence is a by- product of preparation, and in order to succeed you must discipline yourself to establish the habit of doing what need to be done. Now, not tomorrow! 
Affirm to yourself, I have faith and belief in myself that I will achieve my goal because I expect to achieve it, because I will work hard to do so, and that no matter what the circumstances, I will never give up.  
Action is what produces results! Do Power!
The thrust of Aim High is to implant the sixteen steps outlined in this book into your mind as seeds necessary for success. 
We are all born with a powerful toolour brain, and
it is up to each and every one of us to learn how to use that powerful tool more efficiently and effectively.

  <title>Ryan House: In the Heart of Phoenix - Mark Tabb, Holly Cotter, Jonathan Cotter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Heart of Phoenix was written to share the possibility of your community being able to create a sustainable model of world-class caregiving that provides respite, palliative and hospice care for children and their families who are navigating life-limiting or end-of-life journeys.  Award winning author, Mark Tabb, and the Cottor family, take you on a tour from the germination of the vision, to the building, opening and then a glimpse of the full operation today.  Holly and Jonathan Cottor, Ryan&#39;s parents, understand the incredible demands and special care that is required from their firsthand experience: the need for compassion and support while they strain to maintain the uniqueness of each life journey emotionally, spiritually and socially.  A care model like Ryan House is truly a dream born and come-true through the passion and perseverance of the community that creates it.  Ryan House is a Home, a place where children and their families experience respect and love and are embraced throughout their journeys of life as part of a special community. Reading this book, which features stories of beautiful children and families who&#39;ve experienced Ryan House, will no doubt bring tears to your eyes.  But, its purpose is to emphasize the unique mission of Ryan House and how it innovatively came together with the devotion of so many loving, generous and hardworking people in the Phoenix community and throughout Arizona.  This book is truly an inspiration. Learn and believe that it is possible to build and provide a successful model like Ryan House in any community.  All those who have been involved in Ryan House someway, as a volunteer, a board member, a donor, or a recipient of care, hope upon hope that 100s of similar models of care will be built in the US.  It happened in Phoenix, it can happen in your community!" />

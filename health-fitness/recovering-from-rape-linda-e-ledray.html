  <title>Recovering From Rape - Linda E. Ledray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From clinical psychologist Linda E. Ledray, &lt;i&gt;Recovering from Rape&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive handbook offering emotional support and practical guidance to survivors and their loved ones in coping and overcoming the trauma of rape. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been sexually assaulted, you are probably experiencing a mix of fear, anger, and depression. If you are a relative, friend, or lover of someone who has been assaulted, you too may be deeply affected by the incident and by the survivor&#39;s reaction to it. However, working together, survivors and their loved ones &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; recover and may even be able to turn the recovery into an opportunity for positive change and growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of survivors recounted throughout this book reassure readers that others have pulled through. Dr. Ledray helps survivors realize that no matter what they did--wore a low-cut blouse, accepted a ride from a stranger, invited an acquaintance home--they did not deserve to be raped. She guides them from guilt or disbelief through bitterness and despair to the decision to take back control of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, this comprehensive handbook explains what to expect at the police station, at the hospital, and, if necessary, in court. It covers such health issues as incest, STD treatments, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and legal information on prosecution and bail, DNA testing, and rape law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential resource, &lt;i&gt;Recovering from Rape&lt;/i&gt; helps readers learn the most effective ways of dealing with their feelings immediately following an assault, during the subsequent few months, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Tears to Triumph: Women Learn To Live, Love and Thrive - Dawn Marie  Daniels, Candace Sandy, Dr. Jarralynne Agee Ph. D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Learn to embrace the adversity in your life--and be happier. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Women today face bigger personal challenges than ever before. Balancing increasing responsibilities at work while managing a household and caring for children--and more and more often grandparents--is enough to drive &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; to the edge. But every bad boss, souring relationship, and personal struggle is a chance to test your own strengths and resourcefulness.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tears to Triumph&lt;/i&gt; shares a new framework that will help move you beyond just surviving. Here, real women share their stories of triumph over life&#39;s difficult and sometimes tricky, unfair hardships. Most importantly, it shows you how to use your own adversities as a blueprint for future success. You will learn:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;bull;&amp;#160;How to identify the lesson in the moment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;bull;&amp;#160;The cause of stressful behaviors--and the solutions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;bull;&amp;#160;What to look for, how to react, and where to go for more help&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;bull;&amp;#160;Specific ways to insure emotional, interpersonal, and career success&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;bull;&amp;#160;Identify your success pattern based on your unique experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be happy and live a healthy, fulfilling life while rising to meet today&#39;s difficult challenges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dawn Marie Daniels &lt;/b&gt; is the editorial force behind a number of award-winning authors, and has utilized her position to ensure that African American projects get the attention they deserve. Daniels has established a commanding presence in adult nonfiction with such books as &lt;i&gt;In the Meantime&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;One Day My Soul Just Opened Up,&lt;/i&gt; both &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers by Iyanla Vanzant.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Candace Sandy&lt;/b&gt; is the President of Candace Sandy Communications, a multi-media cooperative that targets women.

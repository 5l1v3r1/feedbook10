      <meta name="description" content="The writings from this book represent freedom. When thinking theres no escape mentally, tears shed from my eyes with sadness and anxiety; and so, my thought process believes my voice is only heard on paper. As for me, writing my thoughts on paper helps to eliminate the confusion thats held hostage in my heart and mind. I share my emotions, whether its good or bad and honestly, sometimes its hard to read over the struggles; but in order for me to avoid re-living my biggest fears, I learned that I must give myself a message at the end of each story. Thats when new life comes to restore my joy and I grow from my past to live brighter for my future." />

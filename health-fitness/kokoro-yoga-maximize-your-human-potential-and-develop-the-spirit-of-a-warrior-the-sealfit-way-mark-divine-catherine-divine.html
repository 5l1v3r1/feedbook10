      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kokoro Yoga,&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and former U.S. Navy SEAL Mark Divine, is an integrated physical, mental, and spiritual training, designed initially for the nation&#39;s elite special-ops soldiers and now taught to anyone seeking to develop the heart and mind of a warrior. Kokoro, the Japanese concept of warrior spirit--or merging heart and mind into action--is the central focus of Divine&#39;s new approach to teaching yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coach Divine&#39;s yoga sequences are focused to adapt to all physical and mental capabilities, combining breathing, meditation, and visualization into both traditional poses as well as cross-training/combat-conditioning exercises. His decades of experience with amateur and professional athletes, active and aspiring Navy SEALs, and wounded warriors uniquely qualifies him as an expert motivator and teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Kokoro Yoga&lt;/i&gt; the practitioner will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Get an unbeatable full-body workout through      body-weight functional movements that can be done at home or on the on go&lt;br&gt;* Increase flexibility while building long, lean      muscle mass&lt;br&gt;* Improve physical and mental balance, focus,      and control at all levels--including a special segment designed for those      recovering from PTSD&lt;br&gt;* Find emotional, intuitional, and spiritual harmony      to achieve peak performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coach Divine&#39;s methods have been tested by the toughest warriors in the world. Use this book as a guide to experience the profound power of yoga as a developmental system that will allow you to break through any barriers holding you back.&lt;/p&gt;" />

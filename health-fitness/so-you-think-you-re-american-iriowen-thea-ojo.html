      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ekina was made in America with African parts, but unfortunately this has never made him indestructible. Precocious at ten years old, Ekina knows that physical strength wont help him fend off his overbearing parents, cruel teachers, and one-sided romance. It wont help him save his baby sister from their traditionally-misogynist father or protect his little brother from their mothers expectations either, although it mightve helped him master an adagioif he hadnt quit ballet class. Nigerian boys dont wear pointe shoes, and anyway, who does he think he isan American?&lt;br /&gt;So You Think Youre American is a novel about growing up in that world between foreign and native cultures.

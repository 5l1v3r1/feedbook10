  <title>Low-Carbohydrate Mania - Richard Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many popular books, magazines, and websites claim that we have been following expert medical advice for the past 40 years and we are unhealthier than ever. They declare that the idea that saturated fats and cholesterol cause heart disease is the greatest scientific deception of our times and that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet is essential for our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These views have become accepted as the truth. Instead of informing our society about healthy dietary choices, they are causing widespread harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harding explains why these prevailing views are based on myths, fabrications, and a distortion of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, standard medical advice has not been helpful in reducing the rising prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. This advice often contains guidance such as everything in moderation and that we need to be practical and flexible. Advice that is not very constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the diets that are optimal for our health are also the best for the environment and for the animals we share the earth with.&lt;/p&gt;" />

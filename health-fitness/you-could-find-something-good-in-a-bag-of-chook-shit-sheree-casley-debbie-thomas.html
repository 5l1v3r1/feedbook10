  <title>You Could Find Something Good in a Bag of Chook Shit - Sheree Casley, Debbie Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Yes, this is another self-help book but this one is different from all the rest. Its not going to take you six months to read and the words `enlightenment and `spiritual are nowhere to be found. Brief and to the point, this is a realistic and simple approach to finding some peace in the chaos of everyday life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Written by two sisters who grew up in the same family living with the same circumstances, but dealt with things very differently. Their step dad would say to Sheree You could find something good in a bag of chook shit meaning no matter how bad a situation was Sheree would always find something positive. Debbie on the other hand struggled to have the same optimistic outlook. Together they discovered a way to transform their lives, especially Debbies; it has changed her life from one extreme to the other. They hope this book helps everyone find something good in a bag of chook shit.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>The One Minute Coach to Mastering Your Emotions - Masha Malka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of what you are feeling on a regular basis and at every moment can prevent you from being a zombie and can put you back in control of your emotions, your life and the quality of its experience. If you are tired of being a slave to your emotions, allowing them to run your life, then realize that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book you will learn how to master your emotions, make them your friends, and understand the messages that they bring to help you grow, expand and get in touch with your true self. Every emotion has its place and its reason for being; however, what we do with those emotions is what needs to be mastered so that you can then navigate your life to have the kind of experiences that you most desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is part of &lt;em&gt;The One Minute Coach&lt;/em&gt; series of books - books that are designed for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smart and busy people who often don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to read, even if they would love to;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People who don&amp;rsquo;t just want the information, they want to know what to do with it;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People who understand that the value of a good book is not in how complicated or fancy the words are in it or how thick the book is, but by how much their time invested in reading it gives them a return on that investment based on &lt;em&gt;how the quality of their life improves&lt;/em&gt; during and after they read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written using the rules of the &lt;em&gt;Accelerated Learning Techniques,&lt;/em&gt; which emphasize the use of both right and left hemispheres of the brain for faster and easier learning and later recollection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in this book takes about a minute to read and each chapter is followed by action steps explaining what you can do with the information you just read. This is because I believe that there is already an information overload and what people need is not more information but &lt;em&gt;an understanding of what to do with it. &lt;/em&gt;The image at the end of each chapter helps with the whole brain learning and recollection. It also makes it more fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five parts to this book. The first part introduces you to the world of emotions and helps you see them from a different perspective. The second part focuses on the feel-bad emotions and the third part on the feel-good emotions. The forth part gives you practical tools for mastering your emotions and the fifth part helps you put it all together and integrate your new knowledge into your daily lives. There are also two appendixes that give specific tools to release unwanted emotions.&lt;/p&gt;" />

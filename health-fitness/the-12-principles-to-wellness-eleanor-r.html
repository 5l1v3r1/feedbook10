  <title>The 12 Principles to Wellness - Eleanor R.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From fat, bloated, and on the brink of disaster to healthy, slim, and successful, Eleanor R. tells how &lt;i&gt;The 12 Principles to Wellness &lt;/i&gt;can save your life and then your soul. She will take you through a journey of self-discovery both heart-wrenching and humorous. Eleanor writes honestly and vividly about how she has realized her dreamed of life by surrendering that which she thought she could not give up: first alcohol and then fl our and sugar. Over her twenty-six-year journey, she shares a host of epiphanies and epic discoveries that transform her from a non-believer to a true believer. One by one, she tackles the issues of life that can often cause a person to go back to addictive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a story of hope, joy, and the triumph over self to understand that a joyful life is cultivated with the right thinking, which leads to the healthy behavior. Eleanors fi rst book, &lt;i&gt;The Disease of More, &lt;/i&gt;set the stage. This book continues the chronology of overcoming the devastation of teenage bulimia and alcoholism that continued into young adulthood but was ultimately healed. She tells the story of hitting bottom, self examination, redemption, and self-actualization using the 12 Principles that she sets forth as a formula for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story of persistence and reaching for the knowledge of ones own soul in order to grow proves that one must do more than just put down the first drink or the first bite in order to get well. It is written for people seeking a better way of life, in and out of the rooms of the twelve-step programs everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;" />

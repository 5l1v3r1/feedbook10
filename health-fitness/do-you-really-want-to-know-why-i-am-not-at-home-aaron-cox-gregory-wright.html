  <title>Do You Really Want to Know Why I Am Not at Home? - Aaron Cox, Gregory Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written from the REAL perspective of everyday men and women that struggle with finding peace in their home.  No clinical sounding or Doctoral thesis was necessary to discuss what real people like you and I need to know.  Stop paying the bills for drama to live in your home.  A PLEA FOR CHANGE is here. 
 Long time friends and Co-Authors Gregory Wright and Aaron Cox look at the real issues that divide men and women in todays relationships.  They feel society has conditioned us how to think, act and look.  They also believe mass media ploys are becoming more main stream than family values.  The hearts of men and women in this society have been suppressed by emotional thinking.  They ask the question Is society REALLY interested in your well being and quality of life?  Is it true to say our emotions drive our wants, but needs are attached to the heart? Our chapters will also identify how our wants have taken priority and our needs have been put off until another day that will come too late, if at all.  Please dont be offended or take anything personally, we had to keep it REAL.  Along with some laughs this book guarantees to put you back on track for whats REALLY important and living the American dream and not the American theme.   
Do you REALLY want to know why I am not at home exposes key issues to why we REALLY dont want to be home." />

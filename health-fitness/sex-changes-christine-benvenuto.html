  <title>Sex Changes - Christine Benvenuto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you do when the other woman is your husband? A wife&#39;s memoir of her husband&#39;s sex change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine Benvenuto had been married for more than twenty years--with three young children--when her husband turned to her one night in bed and said &quot;I&#39;m thinking constantly about my gender.&quot; He was unhappy in his body and wanted to become a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part memoir, part voyeur&#39;s look into a marriage, &lt;i&gt;Sex Changes&lt;/i&gt; is a journey through the end of a marriage and out the other side. We see a woman, desperate to save her family and shelter her children, discover a well of strength and resilience she never knew she had. We learn what to tell the neighbors when your husband starts wearing heels with his shirts and ties. We see a woman open herself to a group of friends who travel with her through her darkest times, provide light and levity throughout--and who offer the opportunity to learn how to give as well as receive the love and support of true friendship. When she lost her husband to skirts and hormones, life made Chris a better woman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex Changes&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what one woman discovered about herself in the midst of the conflagration of her family. Fiercely funny, self-lacerating, and not entirely politically correct, &lt;i&gt;Sex Changes&lt;/i&gt; is a journey of love and anguish told with hilarity, heartbreak and a lot of soul searching. It is about the mysteries in every marriage, the secrets we chose to keep, and the freedom that the truth can bring.&lt;/p&gt;" />

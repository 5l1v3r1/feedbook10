  <title>Time to Dream - Nicole Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote Its Time to Dream when my son Kaiden was a baby and I was nursing him. It started out as a lullaby, and I would sing it to him all the time. When I had my second son, Liam, I would sing it to both boys before they went to bed, and it really seemed to soothe them and get them in the sleeping mode. I would sing the lullaby to friends and family, and they always told me I should make it into a book. One day, I woke up and decided to do just that. The book is very special and personal to my family and me. It is my wish that other parents read it to their children and find the same soothing benefits and wonderful bonding time that reading to children always ensures." />

      <meta name="description" content="When we talk about love, there is no style anyway. Love is as big as the world itself, like the ocean and the air, the atmosphere etc. But why love? Does this lead to relevant results? Does love cause love in itself? But then there is no point in proving the cause of what the result is because you cannot know when or where a person will start and end. It&amp;#39;s not worth finding if you have one. If you give it, it&amp;#39;s because you have it. But do you only have it because you give it ... or because you have it? It can be the magic of love. It never stops.&lt;br /&gt;

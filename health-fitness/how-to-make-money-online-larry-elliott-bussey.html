  <title>How to Make Money Online - Larry Elliott Bussey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&quot;HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE&quot;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;EBOOK CREATION FOR ENTREPRENEURS&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;DO IT LIKE THE BIG DOGS!!&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hire for a writer for your ebook, what you are doing is enlisting the services of a ghostwriter. A ghostwriter is a writer who publishes under someone elses name, with the consent of both parties. (Its legal and writers are available to provide the service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The straightest route to ebook profits is in the &lt;u&gt;nonfiction ebook market.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Fiction is making a story; journalism is finding one. Thats the big difference.
When I am writing a book, I am usually dealing with events or ideas that have already arranged themselves in memory. With nonfiction, you need to find your prospective before time has arranged it. &lt;u&gt;The trick is to write about something as if youve been thinking about it for 10 years.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Bussey resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hes an expert on Internet Marketing and Ghostwriting. He has successfully pinned numerous books as a ghostwriter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Bussey makes it his business to be aware of the latest developments in his field as a Pro Internet Marketer / Bloger / Social Media Marketer, Business Expert, Social Marketing Trainer and Consultant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Larry Bussey prides himself as being a thought leader in social media, who likes to inspire others to use new media to create positive change in their lives. Readers of his ebooks write from all over the globe to ask for marketing advise and to share their own success stories.&lt;/P&gt;" />

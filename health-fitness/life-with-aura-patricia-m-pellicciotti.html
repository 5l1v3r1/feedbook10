  <title>Life with Aura - Patricia M. Pellicciotti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Tibetan Tantra and other ancient cultures reveal that an exact knowledge of the illuminated essence, The Aura, is vital to reawaken our consciousness, self-heal and govern our body, mind and spirit as mystics did and do. 
This controversial book explains how you may perceive the Aura by citing case histories and styles. The opus discourages the use of color charts and reveals why and how to find your individual thumbprint for Aura sensing to achieve self-discovery while using the techniques from the ancient knowledge of the Mystics. These illustrated alternatives range from thought processes, actual graphic visualizations, to the more musical or megahertz aspect which is the least known and the most accepted by both the scientific world and occultists. 
Rev. Pellicciotti says, I assure you that all of us possess the innate ability to sense the Aura. During the many years of aura self-healing instructing, it was confirmed that no two people are alike in their diagnostic methodology, but all can achieve what comes naturally to Homo sapiens. To really succeed, people need to have the liberty and guidance to explore and understand their way." />

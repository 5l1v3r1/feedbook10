  <title>When Your Love One Dies - Debi More</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You picked this book up and wanting to know what this is all about. Well in summation the worst thing has happened to you, your spouse has died. In your hands you will find some help to make it through each day. &lt;i&gt;When Your Love One Dies&lt;/i&gt; will help. You are now alone and asking what do I do? From experience being married for 25 years my husband died suddenly. You can never be prepared. But I pray that this book will help cope with all those details you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to get through this? Lots of questions but depend on The Lord and he will guide you. The fact is your spouse is gone. Where do you even start? You have the strength to figure things out. Write everything down, everyone that you speak to, all the phone numbers, and every single piece of information. As things unfolded and dealing with eveything I was so upset not knowing more about what it took to keep our beautiful home running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being unaware made me mad? For instance, do you know the password of your spouces computer, do you know if your cars are in one or both names, do you know where your mortgage is and how much you owe on it. Probabaly not. After several months I had written eveything down, my last word to myself is that I should have known more &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this book your world wont come crashing in, as hard, you will still have heartache because you lost someone you loved. But this will help and guide you through what you need to know and help ease your pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessing&lt;/p&gt;

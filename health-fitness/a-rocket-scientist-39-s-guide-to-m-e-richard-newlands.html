  <title>A Rocket Scientist&#39;s Guide to M.E. - Richard Newlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rick&#39;s book is a wry and acerbic account of his experiences of the illness, including hints and suggestions for fellow M.E. sufferers. You might just learn a bit of rocket science too. M.E. is a depressing subject. Most M.E. books are so woeful you want to reach for the razor blades. So he&#39;s tried to lighten-up this book; who wants to read a dire book when you&#39;re feeling miserable already? He pulls no punches: those of the medical profession that have helped him he praises. Those that were useless, obstructive, or frankly bizarre, come in for damning criticism. He discusses the efficacy of current &#39;best practices&#39; and why a tobacco enema is a bad idea. Included is a hypothesis about what M.E. might be, and how it could be tackled by future research. Though written from a British perspective, he hopes this book will help and amuse M.E sufferers and their carers worldwide. Please bear in mind that he&#39;s a rocket scientist, not a doctor, but he likes to think he&#39;s got a handle on M.E." />

  <title>I&#39;m Not Bitter I&#39;m Better - Cattina C. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written to shine light on the many devastating situations people face on a daily basis. On average, every 40 seconds someone somewhere has committed suicide because they couldnt find a reason to go on. The stories in this book are non fiction and allow readers to understand that things happen, people go through hardships, and situations that lead them to a dead end road. People lose relationships, friends, jobs, and loved ones on a daily basis. Everyone has a story; thus everyone has a past which ultimately hinders their future due to ones inability to let go of past problems. Its not easy; nor is it hard to let go. One must find the courage to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it isnt death; it is HOPE. Finding reasons to continue striving and believingis finding strength within yourselves that you never knew existed. Never allow your past to hinder your futures because the people and (or) things that have brought you to a halt, will not stop functioning because you chose to shut down. Never allow anyone to make you BITTER; but allow those situations to be the reason you are BITTER then yesterday." />

  <title>New York Times Essential Library: Children&#39;s Movies - Peter M. Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An indispensable guide for parents from a leading expert on children&#39;s film&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years Peter M. Nichols has been offering vital advice and information for parents about current movies in his regular &quot;Taking the Children&quot; column. But parents need the same kind of guidance when renting or buying videos and DVDs for their family. They may know that movies such as &lt;i&gt;Toy Story&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chicken Run&lt;/i&gt; are good choices for their children, but Nichols helps parents go beyond the obvious choices to more unconventional movies like &lt;i&gt;The African Queen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Some Like It Hot&lt;/i&gt;. From the classics of animation to a host of great comedies and dramas, Nichols provides a knowing and illuminating guide to one hundred great cinematic works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each brief original essay not only explains why the children will enjoy the film but also allows Nichols to offer timely bits of film history and to discuss certain films in a larger cultural context. Nichols&#39;s knowledge and understanding of films is broad and deep, and many of his choices-especially of films that we might not have thought of as &quot;children&#39;s films&quot;-will surprise and delight readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

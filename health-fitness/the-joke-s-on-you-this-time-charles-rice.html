  <title>The Joke’S on You, This Time - Charles Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like my first literary attempt, The Jokes on Me, this book is primarily a collection of editorials and letters to the editor of the local newspaper, along with running commentary and some attempted justification for the foolishness. The first book would not exist if it hadnt been for the insistence of several people that all this should be in a book.
Most of the letters to the editor in this first section were written under the guise of the Greater Sycamore Valley Chamber of Commerce, an entity that existed only in the minds of its readers. Some of the letters were just personal reflections on the situation of the day. Some of the letters may seem terribly redundant, but I never was one to pass up an opportunity to tell the same joke twice.
The second and most important part of this book contains Sunday Guest Editorials, which I have written for publication in the local newspaper. These editorials deal with issues of a religious nature and were written in the hope that they would stimulate readers to contemplate their own relationship with the One who spoke and all things came into existence." />

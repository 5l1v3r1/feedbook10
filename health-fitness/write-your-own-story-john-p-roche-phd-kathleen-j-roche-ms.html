      <meta name="description" content="Are you unhappy with yourself? Is your relationship not as satisfying as youd like? Do you repeat the same negative patterns over and over againonly to feel discouraged, stuck, anxious, or depressed?
&lt;i&gt;Write Your Own Story&lt;/i&gt; can help you take charge of your life and interrupt these negative patterns. Drawing on research and over forty combined years of experience as therapists specializing in relationship issues, licensed marriage and family therapists John P. Roche, PhD, and Kathleen J. Roche, MS, provide information and insight that will give you the tools youll need to be a happier individual and improve your relationships. To write your own story, you need to be a healthy, independent adult in charge of yourself, making the choices you want to make. &lt;i&gt;Write Your Own Story&lt;/i&gt; shows you how you can turn your life around.
In section one, the Roches discuss the thirty characteristics they have found to be associated with individuals who are psychologically and emotionally healthy. Section two explores the dynamics of selecting a partner who is emotionally and psychologically fit. This section also discusses a number of danger signals or red flags that indicate a difficult partner and trouble ahead. Finally, section three presents what needs to be done to keep each self healthy and the relationship functioning at a high level over time.

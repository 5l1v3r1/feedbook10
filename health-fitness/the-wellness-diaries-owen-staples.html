&lt;p&gt;It offers an account of the authors experience of mental illness-early symptoms, diagnosis, battle with medications, and a plan to end the pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book takes an about turn as the journey is observed and tracked, from despair and suffering, to inspiration, adventure, contagious enthusiasm, and rebuilding a life, one step at a time, through reclaiming health. It includes persuasive arguments as to why health is a choice, and it offers a unique approach to health and wellness from the standpoint of lifestyle, including essential fundamentals such as a plant-based diet, quality sleep and outside activity. It discusses some aspects of health which are sometimes overlooked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers will be touched with tears and laughter, and may wonder when Owen catches a break. Experience his in-depth sincerity in accounting the exact events which shaped this mans recovery from mental illness into a new life filled with gratitude and genuine love for life, the Earth, and all living things, and with a new outlook as a botanist and a naturalist. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A Voice to Myself Opened a Door to Life - Ma’yun Taner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When author Mayun Taners life fell apart, she grasped at any hope she could envision for survival. She found herself asking, Why is this happening to me? In that moment of navet, she realised that her question was not one of blame, but rather of honest inquiry into the path her life had taken. 
That question was the first step on her path to self-responsibility. Soon, she found that each answer inspired another question, inspiring a process that opened a door to a life of love, gratitude, joy, happiness, and abundance. Life is not a set of random and chaotic events. She now knows that what she thinks, feels, expresses, and does are the forces that actually shape her life. 
Among the lessons shes gathered to share are some of the most profound shes learned: 
	The quality of your life does not rely on what you haveor dont have. All that matters is how you use the ingredients of your life. 
	The quality of your life is not defined by your wealth (or lack thereof), your health (or lack thereof), or your abilities (or perceived lack thereof). 
	Your reality is created by your feelings, expressions, and actions.
	Amid the turmoil and challenges of the world, a life filled with love and happiness can be yours. 
	Love, kindness, compassion, honesty, and integrity are the only things that can dispel despair, hatred, violence, poverty, and suffering in this world." />

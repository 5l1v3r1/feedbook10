&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SPRING SEASON OF ONES LIFE:&lt;/strong&gt; Life begins; you walk, talk, and observe all that life throws your way. You experience life and all its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SUMMER SEASON OF ONES LIFE:&lt;/strong&gt; You are now in your 20s, 30s, ad 40s. You have met and lost relationships. You have enjoyed the bonds of union to a womans body, and you have loved, lost, and shattered their hearts and yours. You have known pleasure, sorrow, love, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE FALL SEASON OF ONES LIFE:&lt;/strong&gt; You are still in your 40s, 50s and 60s. You are still searching, the longing process of commitment to a special lady, that special life bond, security, love and happiness that seems to have passed you by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WINTER SEASON OF ONES LIFE:&lt;/strong&gt; You are now in your 60s, 70s and 80s. You have at this age the strong hope of a partner in your life. You long for that special soul mate, and best friend. You long for that special lady to be there, to share, to care, the happy moments, and all lifes memories.&lt;/p&gt;" />

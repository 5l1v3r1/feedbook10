  <title>The Plant Paradox Family Cookbook - Dr. Steven R. Gundry, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Plant Paradox&lt;/em&gt; comes a guide to one-pot cooking for the whole family, with a special focus how to make the Plant Paradox program kid-friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Plant Paradox&lt;/em&gt; in 2017, hundreds of thousands of people have embraced Dr. Gundry&amp;#8217;s nutritional protocol&amp;#8212;and experienced life-changing results. But most of Dr. Gundry&amp;#8217;s readers aren&amp;#8217;t cooking for themselves alone.&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;How can I extend this way of eating to my entire family? And is it safe for my kids?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; are the questions he is most often asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Plant Paradox Family Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Gundry reassures parents as he sets the record straight, providing an overview of children&amp;#8217;s nutritional needs and explaining how we can help our kids thrive on the Plant Paradox program&amp;#8212;a diet low in lectins. Dr. Gundry offers shocking evidence of how the Plant Paradox program is not only &amp;#8220;safe&amp;#8221; for kids, but also the best possible way to set them up for a lifetime of health and responsible eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research continues to bear out, a healthy microbiome&amp;#8212;or &amp;#8220;gut&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;is the cornerstone of human health. The foods we eat at the beginning of our lives have a long-term impact on the makeup of our microbiome. Lectin-containing foods&amp;#8212;such as grains, legumes, certain fruits and vegetables, and conventional dairy&amp;#8212;damage it by creating holes in the gut wall and triggering the kind of systemic inflammation that lays the groundwork for disease. And yet, many of the foods we are routinely told to feed our children&amp;#8212;think milk, whole grain bread, peanut butter&amp;#8212;have an incredibly high lectin content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Plant Paradox Family Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; includes more than 80 recipes that make cooking for a family a breeze. And since pressure cooking is the best and easiest way to reduce lectin content in foods like grains and beans, the majority of the quick and easy recipes are Instant-Pot friendly. From weeknight dinners to make-ahead breakfasts to snacks and even lunchbox-ready meals, &lt;em&gt;The Plant Paradox Family Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; will help the whole family experience the incredible benefits of the Plant Paradox program.&lt;/p&gt;" />

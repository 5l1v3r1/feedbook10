  <title>The Five Stages of Me - Miniely Valdez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Five Stages of Me is a story of my journey through life. I have found that although we grieve the loss of loved ones, we tend to forget that we grieve losing ourselves as well. There comes a time that you hit a roadblock created by your own fears and you go through stages trying to find your way around it. Sometimes the only way to get out of the situation is to go THROUGH it. Five Stages will take you through the roller coaster that I have endured. My ups and downs, pains and joys. You will see it all. In order for me to help you move forward, I needed to be fully honest and show you a woman who has struggled yet found her way. I cannot speak on what I have not experienced. I hope you find peace in reading this book and allow yourself to go THROUGH the roadblock to get to your victory. All you need to do is walk ... What is your next move?" />

As a spiritual being, I was a part of creating miracles in my life as I released the past to live a more positive life. Ive come to believe that we all have an opportunity to make changes for the better. Using personal stories plus tips and tools I developed when I was recovering from a broken back brought me out of depression. I learned being more positive in everything I did helped me overcome my past. I have created Power Circles so other people can make the shifts in their lives, helping them heal. I have online Power Circles and people from Canada, India, Australia, and across the United States use them on a daily basis. Making new choices can spark faith, personal growth, and unlimited possibilities just by changing your attitude.&lt;br /&gt;

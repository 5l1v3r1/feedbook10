  <title>Dujuna Jean&#39;s Last Cry - Geraldine M. Cool</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a rich, spoiled, emotionally disturbed woman Lisa Scott, couldnt cope with the responsibilities of being a mother nor the problems that come with raising a child. Dujuna Jeans mother had been pampered by her rich-influential parents. Nothing was ever too good for their daughter, especially from her father. Shortly after graduation, she and her high school sweetheart married. But neither had any idea what married life was suppose to be. Within the first few months Lisa became pregnant but had a miscarriage, which Larry blamed her for. That didnt stop her from getting pregnant again and this time she carried the baby full term. A little girl that they named Dujuna Jean. Within a year after Dujuna was born, Larry abandoned them, leaving the child to receive the brunt of her mothers frustrations. Dujuna did a lot of crying. So, so many heard her crying but none cared. Not the middle-aged couple who lived next door who heard the poignant sobs in the night, nor the medical establishment that ignored her injuries, nor her wealthy grandparents who were afraid of shame and scandal, nor the divorced father who was absorbed in his own singles fun. Because of the parents wealth every incident was covered up. Only Dr. Ashley Fields suspects when she sees Dujuna Jeans injuries that they were not accidental. But she couldnt prove it for sure, because Dujuna Jean and her beautiful tormented mother werent	telling." />

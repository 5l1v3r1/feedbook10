      <meta name="description" content="About the Book 
Its doesnt matter how many times you fall. What matters is how many times you are able to get up. We all have done and said things we regret. People are dying emotionally and spiritually because those who have conquered difficult times are too embarrassed and ashamed to share their challenges. Enough is enough. We can only hide behind fake smiles, success, relationships, and money for so long and eventually the hurt will come pouring out. In this book you will discover you have the ability to overcome and be victorious. Everything you have been through was preparing you for something great. You do not have to remain bound by your past or permit your current situations to dictate your life. Its time for you to be free." />

  <title>Lora &amp; Isabel: a Lone Novelle - Christina Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A novella about two sisters, Lora and Isabel, who live on opposite ends
of the spectrum while living under the same roof. While they were
once close friends, they are now living completely separate from one
another and are hardly speaking at all.
Lora, deemed the bad, troubled sister by her mother, is the over-analytical
narrator of the story. She is plagued by thoughts of uncertainty and constant
fear of the unknown. Once a misinterpreted girl in and out of psych wards
and therapy, Lora is now a fairly mild-tempered loner who has lost trust in
people because of her past. She was bullied and tormented by her peers while
her sister, Isabel, beautiful and popular, was seemingly living a perfect life.
Lora grew to resent her sister, feeling Isabel abandoned her during the most
miserable time of her life. The narrative tale takes place during one single
day; a day in which Lora decides she is somehow going to change her ways,
quiet her restless mind and overpower her fears." />

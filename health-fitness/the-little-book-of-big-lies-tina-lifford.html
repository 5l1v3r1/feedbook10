  <title>The Little Book of Big Lies - Tina Lifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An inspiring and illuminating guide to true self care, from the sage teacher and breakout star of the critically acclaimed drama, &lt;em&gt;Queen Sugar&lt;/em&gt;, from Executive Producers Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay for OWN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured on &lt;em&gt;Essence Magazine&#39;s &lt;/em&gt;Culture List&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all your years of schooling, did you ever take a single class that explained how to navigate the hurt, drama, and fear that come with living? Tina Lifford sure didn’t. She learned the hard way—through experience as both a Hollywood actress and as the founder of the personal development network The Inner Fitness Project. Now, she brings together her own hard-won insights as well as those of her clients in this helpful and transformative guide. A blend of personal anecdotes and meaningful, practical—and most important, actionable—advice, The Little Book of Big Lies is the life skills class you need to nurture the inner you and move beyond the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fourteen raw, personal stories, Tina teaches you how to change your self-perception—to see yourself in the best possible light, to love and honor what you see, and to forge a new sense of what’s possible in every aspect of your life. But make no mistake, &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Big Lies&lt;/em&gt; is not a “rah-rah” quick fix for fear and pain. Like physical fitness, building and maintaining emotional strength requires continued effort. This invaluable book is the foundation you need to start building inner health and well-being so you can thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tina guides you on a journey of self-discovery that will help you turn shame into self-acceptance, self-rejection into self-love, blame into freedom, and old hurt into power. Wise and powerful, &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Big Lies&lt;/em&gt; will completely change how you think and live.&lt;/p&gt;" />

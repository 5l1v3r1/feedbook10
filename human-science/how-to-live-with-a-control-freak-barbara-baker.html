  <title>How to Live with a Control Freak - Barbara Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you live with a controlling partner? Someone who always wants to make the decisions, about where you go on holiday or what you spend on clothes? Someone who needs to know where you are or what you are doing? Or maybe you work with a control freak? Even though you&#39;ve got the talent, this person takes all the limelight and can&#39;t let go enough to let you get on with your job. Control freaks come in all shapes and sizes. Often they happen to be the people we love. Your friends and family may say &#39;Why don&#39;t you just leave them?&#39;, but it&#39;s not always that simple, especially if you still love the person and have good times together. This book looks at how and why controlling patterns develop in relationships, and what you can do about it if you&#39;re in the middle of one." />

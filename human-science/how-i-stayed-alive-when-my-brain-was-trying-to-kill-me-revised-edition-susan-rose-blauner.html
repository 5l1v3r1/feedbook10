  <title>How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying to Kill Me, Revised Edition - Susan Rose Blauner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOW WITH A NEW CHAPTER AND AN UPDATED RESOURCES SECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide has touched the lives of nearly half of all Americans, yet it is rarely talked about openly. In her highly acclaimed book, Susan Blauner&amp;#8212;a survivor of multiple suicide attempts&amp;#8212;offers guidance and hope for those contemplating ending their lives and for their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Each word written with thoughtful intent; each story told with the deepest of honesty and humility, and in doing so Blauner puts forward a life-saving book.&quot;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel J. Reidenberg, PsyD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Executive Director,&amp;#160;Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (www.save.org)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;I continued to romanticize my death by suicide: who would find me; what I&amp;#8217;d look like. I spent hundreds of hours planning my funeral, imagining the remorse of my family and friends. I wrote good-bye letters, composed wills, and disrupted the lives of everyone close to me. Then reality hit.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Susan Rose Blauner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics on suicide are staggering. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly&amp;#160;800,000 people die by suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds, and for each completed suicide there may be twenty or more attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying to Kill Me&lt;/em&gt;, Susan Blauner is the perfect emissary for a message of hope and a program of action for these millions of people. A survivor of multiple suicide attempts, she explains the complex feelings and fantasies that surround suicidal thoughts. In a direct, nonjudgmental, and loving voice, she offers affirmations and suggestions for those experiencing life-ending thoughts, and for their friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an introduction by Bernie Siegel, M.D., this important, timely book has now been updated with a revised resources section, and a new chapter on the author&amp;#8217;s experiences since the book&amp;#8217;s initial publication.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Spinoza on Reason - Michael LeBuffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his work on metaphysics, Spinoza associates reasons with causes or explanations. He contends that there is a reason for whatever exists and whatever does not exist. In his account of the human mind, Spinoza makes reason a peculiarly powerful kind of idea and the only source of our knowledge of objects in experience. In his moral theory, Spinoza introduces dictates of reason, which are action-guiding prescriptions. In politics, Spinoza suggests that reason, with religion, motivates cooperation in society. Reason shapes Spinoza&#39;s philosophy, and central debates about Spinoza-including his place in the history of philosophy and in the European Enlightenment-turn upon our understanding of these claims.
&lt;em&gt;Spinoza on Reason&lt;/em&gt; starts with striking claims in each of these areas, which Michael LeBuffe draws from Spinoza&#39;s two great works, the &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Theological Political Treatise&lt;/em&gt;. The book takes each characterization of reason on its own terms, explaining the claims and their historical context. While acknowledging the striking variety of reason&#39;s roles, LeBuffe emphasizes the extent to which these different doctrines build upon one another. The result is a rich understanding of the meaning and function of each claim and, in the book&#39;s conclusion, an overview of the contribution of reason to the systematic coherence of Spinoza&#39;s philosophy." />

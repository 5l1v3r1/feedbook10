  <title>Notes on &quot;Camp&quot; - Susan Sontag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From one of the greatest prose stylists of any generation, the essay that inspired the theme of the 2019 Met Gala, &lt;i&gt;Camp: Notes on Fashion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Many things in the world have not been named; and many things, even if they have been named, have never been described. One of these is the sensibility--unmistakably modern, a variant of sophistication but hardly identical with it--that goes by the cult name of &quot;Camp.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins Susan Sontag&#39;s seminal essay &quot;Notes on &#39;Camp.&#39; &quot; Originally published in 1964 and included in her landmark debut essay collection &lt;i&gt;Against Interpretation&lt;/i&gt;, Sontag&#39;s notes set out to define something that even the most well-informed could describe only as &quot;I know it when I see it.&quot; At once grounded in a sweeping history (Louis XIV was pure Camp) and entirely provisional, Camp delights in low and high culture alike. Tiffany lamps, the androgynous beauty of Greta Garbo, &lt;i&gt;King Kong&lt;/i&gt; (1933), and Mozart all embody the Camp sensibility for Sontag--an almost ineffable blend of artifice, extravagance, playfulness, and a deadly seriousness. At the time Sontag published her essay, Camp, as a subversion of sexual norms, had also become a private code of signification for queer communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In nearly every genre and form--from visual art, décor, and fashion to writing, music, and film--Camp continues to be redefined today, as seen in the 2019 Met Gala that took Sontag&#39;s essay as the basis for its theme. &quot;Style is everything,&quot; Sontag tells us, and as &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine points out, &quot; &#39;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot; &#39; launched a new way of thinking,&quot; paving the way for a whole new style of cultural criticism, and describing what is, in many ways, the defining sensibility of our culture today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

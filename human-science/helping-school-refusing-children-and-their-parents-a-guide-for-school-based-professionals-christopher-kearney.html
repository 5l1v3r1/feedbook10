  <title>Helping School Refusing Children and Their Parents: A Guide for School-based Professionals - Christopher Kearney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children who miss substantial amounts of school pose one of the most vexing problems for school officials. In many cases, school personnel must assess these students and successfully help them to return to the academic setting. This can be difficult considering most school-based professionals are pressed for time and do not have access to proper resources. The information in this book can help school officials combat absenteeism and reduce overall dropout rates.   Designed for guidance counselors, teachers, principals and deans, school psychologists, school-based social workers, and other school professionals, this book outlines various strategies for helping children get back to school with less distress that can easily be implemented in schools. The book describes four clinical interventions that can be used to effectively address moderate cases of absenteeism, as well as instructions for adapting these procedures for use within the school system. A chapter on assessment describes several methods for identifying school refusal behavior, including time-limited techniques for school officials who have little opportunity to conduct detailed evaluations. Worksheets for facilitating assessment are included and can easily be photocopied from the book. Other chapters provide advice for working collaboratively with parents, preventing relapse, and tackling special issues such as children with anxiety, children who take medication, and children who are victims of bullying. Topics such as poverty, homelessness, teenage pregnancy, violence, and school safety are also addressed." />

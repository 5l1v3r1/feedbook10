  <title>A Quiet Strong Voice - Lee Horbachewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Quiet Strong Voice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a raw, honest exploration of a torturous journey through depression, anxiety, and multiple suicide attempts. It also serves as a valuable toolbox of thought-provoking questions, steps, and resources.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much Lee for sending copies of &lt;i&gt;A Quiet Strong Voice&lt;/i&gt; to us for the Men at Risk program. I started reading it and I couldnt put it down! It is so inspiring to hear about the depths of your illness and how you worked on your recovery. It is a very hopeful, heart-felt story that will reach people who are suffering or who have been there in the past. You write so well that I could picture you in the settings you describe. I also really appreciate the Chapter 7 to the End Notes, making your book very practical for people to use. The other staff and Executive Director at SPRC are very impressed as well.

&lt;p&gt; Lee Horbachewskis book is a beacon of hope to those who are experiencing the darkness of depression, anxiety or thoughts of suicide. Those who are struggling and those who care for someone who is suffering will find inspiration, hope, and a wealth of resources in this book. With ruthless honesty and deep compassion for herself and others Lee shares her story and reminds us all of the choice to open again and again to learning and life. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; A profoundly helpful, heartfelt and authentic book by a brave and beautiful soul. An opus of overcoming! There are many books written about depression but very few cut to the heart of the matter like this one. Highly recommended! &lt;br&gt;

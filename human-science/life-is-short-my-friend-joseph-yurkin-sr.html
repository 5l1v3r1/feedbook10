  <title>Life Is Short -My Friend - Joseph Yurkin Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once you live as an efficient cause, you establish peace within your heart and soul without any regrets looking backward and forward.  Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.  Trouble no one about religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours.  Love your life, perfect your life, and beautify all things in your life.  Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.
Prepare a noble death song for the day you go over the great divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place.  Show respect to all people and grovel to none.  When you rise in the morning give thanks for the food and the joy of living.  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault only lies in yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse the wise ones to fool and robs the spirit of its vision.
When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear o death, so when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.
Sing your death song and die like a hero going home." />

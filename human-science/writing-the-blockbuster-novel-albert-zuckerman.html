  <title>Writing the Blockbuster Novel - Albert Zuckerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Albert Zuckerman, legendary literary agent, has worked with many bestselling authors, including Ken Follett, Olivia Goldsmith, Antoinette Van Heugten, Michael Lewis, and F. Paul Wilson. Zuckerman is a master at teaching writers the skills necessary to crack the bestseller list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this revised edition of &lt;i&gt;Writing the Blockbuster Novel&lt;/i&gt;, Zuckerman has added an analysis of Nora Roberts&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Witness&lt;/i&gt;, which he uses along with classic books like &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Godfather, &lt;/i&gt;to illustrate his points. Zuckerman&#39;s commentary on Ken Follett&#39;s working outlines for &lt;i&gt;The Man From St. Petersburg &lt;/i&gt;provide a blueprint for building links between plot and character. A new introduction discusses social media and self-publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing the Blockbuster Novel&lt;/i&gt; is an essential tool for any aspiring author. As Dan Brown said in an interview: &quot;Not long ago, I had an amusing experience meeting the author of a book I received as a gift nearly two decades ago a book that in many ways changed my life. I was halfway through writing my first novel when I was given a copy of &lt;i&gt;Writing the Blockbuster Novel&lt;/i&gt;. [Zuckerman&#39;s] book helped me complete my manuscript and get it published. [When] I met Mr. Zuckerman for the first time. I gratefully told him that he had helped me. He jokingly replied that he planned to tell everyone that he had helped me write &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

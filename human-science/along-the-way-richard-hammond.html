  <title>Along the Way - Richard Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;This book may be unpopular in some circles. The exposure of the truth usually is when it has been hidden or distorted (particularly by those who would profit most by its absence or continued distortion). Yet, are we not our brothers keeper? Are we not to assist or enlighten our kinsmen...our fellow human, if we can?	Frequently, throughout these essays will be found references to the mystical forces that are indeed a part of our every day existence. I speak of the essence of fair play, charity, right...justice. These forces are more than just charming concepts or notions. They are forces that shape every living souls destiny...forces that we sometimes foolishly play with every day, often with terrible consequences. 
&lt;br&gt;	There are bogus philosophies being practiced that have been and are rapidly and steadily spelling the decline of humankind. I seek, with the readers indulgence and patience, to expose or illuminate our long practiced folly. I expect there to be great opposition, particularly from many of the Black segment of Christendom. For oftentimes, concepts and ideals are attacked and/or ostracized by the masses while being led by profiteers with selfish interests, especially if those ideals are not embraced by the masses. But, are the masses always right? What about a mob?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;	The focal point of these essays is not to lament the plight of the so-called African American. Any number of American minorities (Native American, Hispanics, Oriental, et al) can be exemplary of the casualties of the American (European) encounter, though not necessarily to the same degree. I use the African American to illustrate what has happened to a segment of humanity (many of whom I believe to be descendants of the  Lost Tribes of Israel,  the Chosen Ones) whose ancestors dared to violate the laws and hold with contempt those forces which govern our daily existence and bring affront to the Great Spirit, The Mighty One. And if the Chosen of the Most High can receive such a fall from grace, then none are above or beyond reproach. Perhaps now is the time for other considerations...other possibilities." />

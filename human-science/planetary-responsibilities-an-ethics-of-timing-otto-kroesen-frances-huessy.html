  <title>Planetary Responsibilities: An Ethics of Timing - Otto Kroesen, Frances Huessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An ethics of timing--each moment in time requires a responsible answer. New values emerge with new challenges, but we also draw from former learning experiences, values, and human qualities. How does social dialogue create a common support base for dealing with change? How can economics and politics be effectively organized by such interaction? How to answer questions of intercultural management and peace to prevent a clash of civilizations?  Differences should not be erased; instead, they should be coordinated by timely alternation. By listening to the times we are in and to each other, we create a common standard of understanding of the way forward. The heritage of Western (and perhaps Christian) modernity can be coordinated with older layers of culture and management from the East and the South to make planetary biographies. For instance, once the planets in the sky were constantly on the move in always-surprising windings. Now, human individuals have to find their way by making creative use of the existing value repertoire of many traditions. Such a type of intercultural management contributes to the re-creation of the planet. In the process, people find their personal destination in a unique planetary biography." />

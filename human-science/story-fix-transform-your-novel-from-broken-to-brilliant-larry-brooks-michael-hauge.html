  <title>Story Fix: Transform Your Novel from Broken to Brilliant - Larry Brooks, Michael Hauge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinvigorate Your Fiction!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve written the first draft of your novel or screenplay, and you&amp;#39;ve released it into the world: to your critique group, to your most trusted beta readers, or even to an agent or an editor. But something&amp;#39;s wrong. You&amp;#39;re not getting the glowing response you had expected, or you might have even received a rejection. Your story is getting a &amp;quot;Meh...&amp;quot; when you had hoped for an &amp;quot;Amazing!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But have no fear--the piece you&amp;#39;ve sweated and bled over isn&amp;#39;t dead on arrival. It just needs fixing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Story Fix&lt;/i&gt; is the answer to your revision needs. With practical techniques from critically acclaimed author and story coach Larry Brooks, you will learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a story-fixing mind-set&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate the two essential realms of revision: story and execution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluate your novel or screenplay against twelve crucial storytelling elements and essences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen your concept and premise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Punch up the dramatic tension, pacing, thematic weight, characterization, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align your story with proven structural principles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Filled with candid advice on the realities of the publishing world and helpful case studies of real authors who fixed their own stories, &lt;i&gt;Story Fix&lt;/i&gt; isn&amp;#39;t just about revision--it&amp;#39;s about resurrection. Infuse your fiction with a much-needed jolt of electricity, and bring it back to life.&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Larry Brooks is a superb storyteller and teacher. If anyone can fix your novel, it&amp;#39;s him. Put this one on your desk and read it often.&amp;quot; --&lt;b&gt;Robert Dugoni&lt;/b&gt;, #1 Amazon and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;My Sister&amp;#39;s Grave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Story Fix&lt;/i&gt; is the ultimate writer&amp;#39;s companion for taking any manuscript to the next level.

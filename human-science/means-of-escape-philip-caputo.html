  <title>Means of Escape - Philip Caputo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A riveting memoir of years of living dangerously.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the countless readers who have admired Philip Caputo&#39;s classic memoir of Vietnam, &lt;i&gt;A Rumor of War&lt;/i&gt;, here is his powerful recounting of his life and adventures, updated with a foreword that assesses the state of the world and the journalist&#39;s art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, Caputo has covered many of the world&#39;s troubles, and in &lt;i&gt;Means of Escape&lt;/i&gt;, he tells the reader in moving and clear-eyed prose how he made himself into a writer, traveler, and observer with the nerve to put himself at the center of the world&#39;s conflicts. As a young reporter he investigated the Mafia in Chicago, earning acclaim as well as threats against his safety. Later, he rode camels through the desert and enjoyed Bedouin hospitality, was kidnapped and held captive by Islamic extremists, and was targeted and hit by sniper fire in Beirut, with memories of Vietnam never far from the surface. And after it all, he went into Afghanistan. Caputo&#39;s goal has always been to bear witness to the crimes, ambitions, fears, ferocities, and hopes of humanity. With &lt;i&gt;Means of Escape&lt;/i&gt;, he has done so.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Digital Curation, Second Edition - Gillian Oliver, Ross Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As an in-depth explanation of the entire digital curation lifecycle, from creation to appraisal to preservation to organization/access to transformation, the first edition of this text set a benchmark for both thoroughness and clarity. Boasting the expert guidance of international authorities Oliver and Harvey, this revamped and expanded edition widens the scope to address continuing developments in the strategies, technological approaches, and activities that are part of this rapidly changing field. In addition to current practitioners, those pursuing a career as librarian, archivist, or records manager will find this definitive survey invaluable. Filled with up-to-date best practices, it covers such important topics as
    the scope and incentives of digital curation, detailing Digital Curation Centre’s (DCC) lifecycle model as well as the Data Curation Continuum;   
    key requirements for digital curation, from description and representation to planning and collaboration;
    the value and utility of metadata;
    considering the needs of producers and consumers when creating an appraisal and selection policy for digital objects;
    the paradigm shift by institutions towards cloud computing and its impact on costs, storage, and other key aspects of digital curation;
    the quality and security of data;
    new and emerging data curation resources, including innovative digital repository software and digital forensics tools;
    mechanisms for sharing and reusing data, with expanded sections on open access, open data, and open standards initiatives; and
    processes to ensure that data are preserved and remain usable over time.
Useful as both a teaching text and day-to-day working guide, this book outlines the essential concepts and techniques that are crucial to preserving the longevity of digital resources." />

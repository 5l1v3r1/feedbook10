  <title>Revelations of an Ugly Old Hag - Dolly Delanty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theses vignettes, written in satire, describe the happenings taking place in a retirement home and in Australia. The author herself presently resides in a seniors residence. She hopes that it is recognized by the readersif there are anythat these essays (or whatever you want to call them) are written tongue-in-cheek and are not to be taken too seriously.
The author, Dolly Delanty, has enjoyed every minute writing this book.
In other words, she has had a hell of a good time being crass and rude. It has been very liberating for her. She thinks more people should do it!
This book takes you to a retirement residence situated somewhere in North America and to the southern coast of Australia.
The author talks about the weird fellow seniors she meets along the way.
She talks about her strained relationship with her daughters Aussie husband and relates funny situations presented to her by the in-laws from hell.
Its light reading and fun as well. All that is required is an open mind and a sick sense of humor." />

  <title>Giambattista Vico - Giambattista Vico, Thora Ilin Bayer, Donald Phillip Verene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;Giambattista Vico: Keys to the &quot;New Science&quot;&lt;/em&gt; brings together in one volume translations, commentaries, and essays that illuminate the background of Giambattista Vico&#39;s major work. Thora Ilin Bayer and Donald Phillip Verene have collected a series of texts that help us to understand the progress of Vico&#39;s thinking, culminating in the definitive version of the &lt;em&gt;New Science&lt;/em&gt;, which was published in 1744.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
 Bayer and Verene provide useful introductions both to the collection as a whole and to the individual writings. What emerges is a clear picture of the decades-long process through which Vico elaborated his revolutionary theory of history and culture. Of particular interest are the first sketch of the new science from his earlier work, the &lt;em&gt;Universal Law&lt;/em&gt;, and Vico&#39;s response to the false book notice regarding the first version of his New Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
 The volume also includes additions to the 1744 edition that Vico had written out but that do not appear in the English translations—including his brief chapter on the &quot;Reprehension of the Metaphysics of Descartes, Spinoza, and Locke&quot;—and a bibliography of all of Vico&#39;s writings that have appeared in English. &lt;em&gt;Giambattista Vico: Keys to the &quot;New Science&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is a unique and vital companion for anyone reading or rereading this landmark of Western intellectual history.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Emotional Honesty &amp; Self-Acceptance - Ronald R. Brill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;There is no excuse for not teaching preventive, healthy coping strategies to prepare kids for their teenage years.&lt;/i&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;Ronald R. Brill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In his innovative book, Emotional Honesty &amp; Self-Acceptance, Ronald Brill, a former university professor and health educator, argues that youth can learn how to self-manage upsetting and stressful experiences.  This work explains the relationship between recognizing and dealing with emotional pain, which is essential to avoid harmful behavior toward ones self and others.  Since the book was published in 2000 he continues to research and develop training programs for educators, including advising schools and student services professionals so they can more effectively help students learn and practice brain-based coping skills to reduce thigh risk emotional stress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book contains guiding principles used in classroom programs he introduced to over 700 4th to 6th grade elementary students from 2002 to 2008.  His virtual classroom website, www.copingskills4kids.net, helps schools, parents and counselors guide children in the use of healthy and safe coping skills.  The book and website are designed to enable recovery from everyday emotional pain caused by &lt;b&gt;loss, rejection, betrayal and humiliation&lt;/b&gt;.  He refers to these as universal, core Emotionally Wounding Experiences.  Like physical wounds, emotional ones can also be infected if left unattended or ignored. His classroom programs prove that by age of nine, students can learn these lessons to begin preparing for the turbulent teenage years.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Violence prevention&lt;/b&gt; is an important benefit of developing emotional resilience and self-acceptance.  The authors commitment to brain-based coping skills learning is now shared by tens of thousands of individuals and institutions around the world seeking new ways to help youth avoid harming others for the emotionally wounds they may otherwise have not learned to heal. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 300-page book uses analysis of school shooting incidents to advocate new strategies schools and parents can use to boost kids coping confidence needed to more easily get over inevitable emotionally painful and stressful experiences.   It is written for mature teenagers and adults. This powerful tool provides evidence to those advocating coping skills education programs at home and school.  This approach with todays youth can make them more responsible and self-accepting persons.  It also helps them develop new capabilities to deal with the emotional challenges and changes during adolescence.

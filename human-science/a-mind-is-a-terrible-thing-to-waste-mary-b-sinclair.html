  <title>A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste - Mary B. Sinclair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is a comedy and a social satire about how everyone starts out idealistically chomping at the bit to use their mind to the fullest. (A Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Waste after all according to that Old School Traditional philosophy.) But after a while it sooner or later dawns on most everyone that what they are really doing is wasting
their mind anyway. (Not only because no one ever LISTENS, but because nothing works the way it has been talked up). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; Its an up close and personal picture of how it feels when life throws you a curved ball (or a lot of lemons from which you have to figure out how to make lemonade). Its an emotional snapshot of how traumatic it is when nothing works out the way you once thought it would. When all those
wonderful ideas and oh, so compelling words and theories cease to make any sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;But, rather than offering the reader a roadmap, it attempts to give an explanation for why nothing ever works. And how it feels to spin your wheels when your back is to the wall. And youre neck and neck with all those nasty, infuriating unmentionables centering around all that
social control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Along with the downside, however, there is an equal and opposite upside. The world of Songs (and Poetry) is held up as a guiding principle through which to regain your spiritual
balance, gradually become unstuck and once again able to reboot yourself in a new direction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Its also much more than a blame yourself for everything and get out of your own way guilt trip since it rejects all those simplistic clich solutions found in Psychology books. Attempting instead to give the reader a much more focused insight into all those hard to put into words political, social and philosophical outside forces that affect why and how things can (and do) go wrong." />

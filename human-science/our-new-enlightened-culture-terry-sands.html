  <title>Our New Enlightened Culture - Terry Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the fourth book in my series of sequels to on Our New Human Consciousness. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first book in this series, Our Global Wave of Change, discusses the nature of the massive change we are experiencing, how this change affects us as individuals and as a culture, and steps you can take to survive the change psychologically. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second book, Our New Human MindSkills, discusses how we will the change the way we use our mind and practical steps you can take to re-engineer your mental operating system. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The third book, Our New Path of Self-Discovery, discusses the question of Who am I, and why am I here, the history of the spiritual path imported from other cultures and religions, our new path of self-discovery for truth and enlightenment in our culture.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this fourth book, Our New Enlightened Culture, we broaden our scope and look at how the new path of self-discovery extends to the upliftment and enlightenment of our culture.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are a culture in search of its spirit, and the implications for our culture are massive as our perspective of reality expands.  Many of those whose awareness is opening in this time of change will extend their consciousness to share in accepting responsibility for our new culture.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who are the new Pathfinders? &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The new Pathfinders will share the new knowledge and help facilitate the acceptance and implementation of our new culture.  If you are a pathfinder, you too may have asked Who me? Why me? The key to the implementation is in the process: the elements of this new consciousness and culture will not come from one enlightened teacher who stands on the mountain and proclaims the truth. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This new cultural consciousness will be manifested from within each of us: you, me, and the person next door. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I wish you well in your work." />

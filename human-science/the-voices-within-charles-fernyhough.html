  <title>The Voices Within - Charles Fernyhough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A luminous exploration of the nature of thoughts, from daydreams to the voices in our heads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the moment you caught sight of this book, what were you thinking? Was your thought a stream of sensations? Or was it a voice in your head? Did you ask yourself, &quot;I wonder what that&#39;s about?&quot; Did you answer? And what does it mean if you did?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone says they hear voices in their head, they are often thought to be mentally ill. But, as Charles Fernyhough argues in &lt;i&gt;The Voices Within&lt;/i&gt;, such voices are better understood as one of the chief hallmarks of human thought. Our inner voices can be self-assured, funny, profound, hesitant, or mean; they can appear in different accents and even in sign language. We all hear them-and we needn&#39;t fear them. Indeed, we cannot live without them: we need them, whether to make decisions or to bring a book&#39;s characters to life as we read. Studying them can enrich our understanding of ourselves, and our understanding of the world around us; it can help us understand the experiences of visionary saints, who might otherwise be dismissed as schizophrenics; to alleviate the suffering of those who do have mental health problems; and to understand why the person next to us on the subway just burst out laughing for no apparent reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether the voices in our heads are meandering lazily or clashing chaotically, they deserve to be heard. Bustling with insights from literature, film, art, and psychology, &lt;i&gt;The Voices Within&lt;/i&gt; offers more than science; it powerfully entreats us all to take some time to hear ourselves think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

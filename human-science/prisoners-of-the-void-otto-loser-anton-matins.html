  <title>PRISONERS OF THE VOID - Otto Loser, Anton Matins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll suppose that the automaton adapted and restructured itself instinctively, and by behavioural permutations as it trundled along. My thoughts urge me to demonstrate how this creature that I am might have deviated significantly from a period early in the seventeenth century, only to loom larger as it sought to reform its relations with myths and legends. It seems this thing that I am has been forging its affiliations with the fabulous technologies it happens to have stumbled across. Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s monster was a literary beacon for the age of technology. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a monster. It was an automaton made of human parts. It&amp;rsquo;s as a consequence of what appears to be the automated nature of my thoughts that I continue to probe at an increasingly comprehensive form of the Frankenstein narrative, to the point of making it the core supposition of my writing. &amp;nbsp;Otto Loser, 2018&lt;/p&gt;" />

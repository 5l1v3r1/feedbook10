  <title>Read the Face - Eric Standop, Elisa Petrini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relearn the intuitive language of face reading &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From birth, face is our first language. We are born face readers--knowing to seek out human features and faces from the moment our eyes open. We all have the intuitive ability to read and interpret the feelings and expressions of those around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Read the Face&lt;/i&gt;, master face reader Eric Standop unlocks the power of this innate human ability, sharing his own journey to become a face reading master, along with stories that illustrate the power of this unique language. Using a combination of three different schools of face reading, along with a scientific accuracy to detect the most fleeting microexpressions, Standop is able to read personality, character, emotions, and even the state of a person&#39;s health--all from simply glancing at their face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book is divided into sections focusing on specific ways that face reading can offer insight, such as Health, Love, Communication, Work and Success. The stories are accompanied by detailed black and white illustrations of faces, allowing readers to observe the same features that Standop interpreted.  The final section of the book outlines the meanings of dozens of facial features and face shapes, so that readers can recognize their own innate intuitive powers and develop them. &lt;i&gt;Read the Face&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to using the ancient art and science of face reading to go beyond the surface and create the boldest life possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />

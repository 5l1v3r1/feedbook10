  <title>Late Edition - Bob Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A loving and laughter-filled trip back to a lost American time when the newspaper business was the happiest game in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a warm, affectionate true-life tale, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Bob Greene &lt;i&gt;(When We Get to Surf City, Duty, Once Upon a Town) &lt;/i&gt;travels back to a place where--when little more than a boy--he had the grand good luck to find himself surrounded by a brotherhood and sisterhood of wayward misfits who, on the mezzanine of a Midwestern building, put out a daily newspaper that didn&#39;t even know it had already started to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In some American cities,&quot; Greene writes, &quot;famous journalists at mighty and world-renowned papers changed the course of history with their reporting.&quot;  But at the &lt;i&gt;Columbus Citizen-Journal&lt;/i&gt;, there was a willful rejection of grandeur--these were overworked reporters and snazzy sportswriters, nerve-frazzled editors and insult-spewing photographers, who found pure joy in the fact that, each morning, they awakened to realize: &quot;I get to go down to the paper again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least that is how it seemed in the eyes of the novice copyboy who saw romance in every grungy pastepot, a symphony in the song of every creaking typewriter.  With current-day developments in the American newspaper industry so grim and dreary, &lt;i&gt;Late Edition &lt;/i&gt;is a Valentine to an era that was gleefully cocky and seemingly free from care, a wonderful story as bracing and welcome as the sound of a rolled-up paper thumping onto the front stoop just after dawn.&lt;/p&gt;" />

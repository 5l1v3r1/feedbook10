  <title>Simple Stunning Wedding Etiquette: Traditions, Answers, and Advice from One of Today&#39;s Top Wedding Planners - Karen Bussen</title>

What do you say to people who ask to bring their (uninvited) children to the reception-or, scarier still, to your prospective mother-in-law when she picks out the World&#39;s Ugliest Dress to wear on your big day?&lt;P&gt;Brides-to-be have a lot on their minds, including making sure that everything connected with the wedding is done the &quot;right way.&quot; But nowadays few people are adequately schooled in the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of proper etiquette-and that&#39;s where Simple Stunning Wedding Etiquette comes to the desperately needed rescue.&lt;P&gt;This newest volume in Karen Bussen&#39;s Simple Stunning Wedding series-whose four previous books total more than 130,000 copies in print-is the perfect marriage between the timeless and the new. Bussen celebrates the beloved rituals (cake-cutting, toasts) that are well worth preserving, while dispensing with outmoded rites (the garter toss) best left by the wayside. And Bussen&#39;s guide goes beyond other wedding etiquette handbooks by dealing sensitively with the sometimes-fraught issues (divorced parents, second marriages, blending religious traditions) so crucial to contemporary wedding planning." />

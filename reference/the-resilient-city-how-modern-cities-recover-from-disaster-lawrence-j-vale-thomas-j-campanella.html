  <title>The Resilient City: How Modern Cities Recover from Disaster  - Lawrence J. Vale, Thomas J. Campanella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For as long as they have existed, cities have been destroyed--sacked, shaken, burnt, bombed, flooded, starved, irradiated, and pillaged--in almost every case they have risen again. Rarely in modern times has a city not been rebuilt following destruction, be it natural or man-made. The Resilient City explores urban disasters from around the globe and the ongoing restoration of urban life. It examines why cities are rebuilt, how a vision for the future gets incorporated into a new urban landscape, and how disasters have been interpreted and commemorated in built form.  An international cast of historians, architects, and urban studies experts looks at a diverse group of cities that have suffered traumas, including: * the Oklahoma City bombing   * Chicagos great fire of 1871   * San Franciscos earthquake and fires of 1906   * Washingtons invasion by the British during the War of 1812   * Berlin and Warsaw in World War II   * Gernikas bombardment during the Spanish Civil War   * Jerusalems rebuilding following centuries of destruction   * Mexico Citys 1985 earthquake   * Chinas Tangshan earthquake   * Tokyos earthquake, fires, and WWII bombardment   * Beirut in the 1990s wars   * South Central Los Angeles following the Rodney King beating   In so doing, they bring to light the experiences these resilient cities share, while underscoring that no two cities have recovered in the precisely the same way. This book will appeal to anyone interested in cities, among humankinds most durable artifacts and enduring forms of communal life." />

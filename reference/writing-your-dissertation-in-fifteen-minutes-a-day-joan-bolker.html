  <title>Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day - Joan Bolker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Expert writing advice from the editor of the Boston Globe best-seller, The Writer&#39;s Home Companion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissertation writers need strong, practical advice, as well as someone to assure them that their struggles aren&#39;t unique. Joan Bolker, midwife to more than one hundred dissertations and co-founder of the Harvard Writing Center, offers invaluable suggestions for the graduate-student writer. Using positive reinforcement, she begins by reminding thesis writers that being able to devote themselves to a project that truly interests them can be a pleasurable adventure. She encourages them to pay close attention to their writing method in order to discover their individual work strategies that promote productivity; to stop feeling fearful that they may disappoint their advisors or family members; and to tailor their theses to their own writing style and personality needs. Using field-tested strategies she assists the student through the entire thesis-writing process, offering advice on choosing a topic and an advisor, on disciplining one&#39;s self to work at least fifteen minutes each day; setting short-term deadlines, on revising and defing the thesis, and on life and publication after the dissertation. Bolker makes writing the dissertation an enjoyable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>A Gentleman Walks Down the Aisle - John Bridges, Bryan Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He may not have been dreaming of this magical day since childhood, but a groom&#39;s role in his wedding is as important as his bride&#39;s. This guide will shape even the most baffled groom into a well-mannered gentleman, from engagement party to reception and every blessed event in between. Authors John Bridges and Bryan Curtis even offer advice for every male member of the wedding party. Fathers, groomsmen, ring bearers, and guests, take note! Bridges and Curtis have included everything a gentleman should know to skillfully assume his role at a wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How not to propose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The truth about bachelor parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who pays for what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips for a pitch-perfect toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to calm an indignant mother-in-law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to stay quiet and when to speak up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dozens of phrases a gentleman should never utter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to wear and when to wear it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secret to a perfect thank-you note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t let the blur of tux fittings, place settings, family gatherings, and monogramming overwhelm the simple objective of a wedding. &lt;em&gt;A Gentleman Walks Down the Aisle&lt;/em&gt; will help him understand the delicate art of being a man on one of life&#39;s most important days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groom and his fellow gentlemen may find themselves left to their own devices as the wedding day approaches, but their role is every bit as important as arranging the flowers or selecting the font for the wedding invitations. For the groom, the fathers of the bride and groom, the best man, the groom&#39;s attendants, and even the gentleman who participates in the celebration merely as a guest, this book explains what to do, where to stand, what to wear, and what to say.&lt;/p&gt;" />

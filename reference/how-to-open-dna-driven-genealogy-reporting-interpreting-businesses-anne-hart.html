  <title>How to Open Dna-Driven Genealogy Reporting &amp; Interpreting Businesses - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here&#39;s how to open your own online DNA-driven genealogy reporting/interpreting service business. You wouldn&#39;t do the actual DNA testing. The laboratory you contract with does the testing and sends you reports that you interpret for your clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a DNA-driven genealogist, you would prepare illustrated and text-driven reports, colorful CDs, brochures, press kits, covers, Web sites, and guides to interpreting the DNA-for-ancestry-based information. You would interpret tests for deep ancestry to your clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What verbal skills and any other preparation would you need to empower consumers with knowledge from reports you receive from your partnering DNA-testing laboratory? Would you also interpret reports from genetics counselors testing for predisposition to diseases? Or emphasize only deep ancestry? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you need a self-taught science background, a genealogy hobby, or only marketing and communications experience? Who does the actual interpreting? How would you contract with DNA laboratories to send reports and other information related to ancestry? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be a genealogist, a personal historian, or a life story videographer thinking of partnering with a DNA-testing laboratory. Your business would be to make complex information easy to understand and interpret in plain language DNA reports from scientists to genealogy clients and surname groups. The DNA tests could be for ancestry and/or nutritional genomics issues.&lt;/p&gt;" />

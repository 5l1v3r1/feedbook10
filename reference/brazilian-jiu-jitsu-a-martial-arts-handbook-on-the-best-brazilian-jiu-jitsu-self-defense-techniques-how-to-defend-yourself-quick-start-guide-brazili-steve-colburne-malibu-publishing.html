A majority of the techniques used with the martial art are executed on the ground.  The techniques involve very little strength from the stylist, as most of them are all about the technique behind the move.  With Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu stylists that weight 100 lbs. or less can quickly put a submission lock on someone who is 2 - 3 times their weight and size." />

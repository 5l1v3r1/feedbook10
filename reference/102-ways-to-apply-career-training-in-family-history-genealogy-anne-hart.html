  <title>102 Ways to Apply Career Training in Family History/Genealogy - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here are 102+ ways to use training in family history and genealogy when applied to real-world careers in education, business, or government, including creative entrepreneurial start-ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With the future marriage of genealogy to smart cards, online databases, or similar authentication technology for family history, population registration (census), and library research, it may be easier to research family lines, not only by DNA matches through DNA testing for deep ancestry, but also with smart, electronic cards designed for electronic identity. It&#39;s also a way to track military records as another way to trace family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Careers and research may focus on various state libraries or historical associations. History and family studies are part of an interdisciplinary liberal arts program that emphasizes research and writing. Journalism courses help round out your ability to express in plain language the results of your reading, explorations, and interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Obtaining a degree or even taking one course or self-study in Family, Public, or Social History can lead to broad, interdisciplinary careers. Graduate work in library science, law, journalism, public history, or genetics counseling (with a double major in the life sciences and social work) also lead to careers in which an historical education may be used." />

  <title>Who&#39;s Buying Which Popular Short Fiction Now, &amp; What Are They Paying? - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Online booksellers are rapidly becoming online publishers. Sell your short fiction or nonfiction to the newest markets.&lt;/p&gt;
Anyone who publishes your compiled short stories, novels, or nonfiction is looking for more opportunities to market your work. If you have published your stories or nonfiction with a mainstream or print-on-demand publisher, that firm cooperates with online booksellers.&lt;/p&gt;
They probably want to leverage serial rights opportunities with your short stories, articles, or nonfiction excerpts from your books. After publication, you need to drive people to online booksellers&#39; Web sites and your own to create visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
The revolution is in virtual book tours and online marketing with booksellers. Another hidden market is short story publishing rights&#39; auctions online to create visibility. You sell your writing as you&#39;d sell a product at one of the online auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
Long before finding any publisher or after the &quot;face-out shelf life&quot; of your book is over, sell or pre-sell your creations online. Offer short stories or articles to the public for a small fee to download.&lt;/p&gt;
The music and movie industry do it. So can you. Online booksellers already are famous for a targeted community of readers that buy online.&lt;/p&gt;
That&#39;s only one hint of hidden markets for authors that want to be well-paid for short stories or brief nonfiction. Here&#39;s how to write, customize, and market precisely what these merchants want. Here&#39;s how to pose the least financial risk to them." />

  <title>The Secrets of Story: Innovative Tools for Perfecting Your Fiction and Captivating Readers - Matt Bird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;You&amp;#39;ve just boarded a plane. You&amp;#39;ve loaded your phone with your favorite podcasts, but before you can pop in your earbuds, disaster strikes: The guy in the next seat starts telling you all about something crazy that happened to him--in great detail. This is the unwelcome storyteller, trying to convince a reluctant audience to care about his story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We all hate that guy, right? But when you tell a story (any kind of story: a novel, a memoir, a screenplay, a stage play, a comic, or even a cover letter), you become the unwelcome storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So how can you write a story that audiences will embrace? The answer is simple: Remember what it feels like to be that jaded audience. Tell the story that would win you over, even if you didn&amp;#39;t want to hear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Secrets of Story&lt;/i&gt; provides comprehensive, audience-focused strategies for becoming a master storyteller. Armed with the Ultimate Story Checklist, you can improve every aspect of your fiction writing with incisive questions like these: &amp;#160;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concept:&lt;/b&gt; Is the one-sentence description of your story uniquely appealing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Character:&lt;/b&gt; Can your audience identify with your hero?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structure and Plot:&lt;/b&gt; Is your story ruled by human nature?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scene Work:&lt;/b&gt; Does each scene advance the plot and reveal character through emotional reactions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dialogue:&lt;/b&gt; Is your characters&amp;#39; dialogue infused with distinct personality traits and speech patterns based on their lives and backgrounds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tone:&lt;/b&gt; Are you subtly setting, resetting, and upsetting expectations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theme:&lt;/b&gt; Are you using multiple ironies throughout the story to create meaning?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;To succeed in the world of fiction and film, you have to work on every aspect of your craft and satisfy your audience. Do both--and so much more--with &lt;i&gt;The Secrets of Story&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Matt Bird is a certifiable writing-craft genius.&amp;quot; --&lt;b&gt;Cheryl Klein&lt;/b&gt;, Senior Editor at Arthur A.

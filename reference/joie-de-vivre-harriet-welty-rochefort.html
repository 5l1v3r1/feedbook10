  <title>Joie de Vivre - Harriet Welty Rochefort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An engaging exploration of the style that permeates all things French--perfect for anyone looking to achieve that classic French flair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Harriet Welty Rochefort, an American who has lived in France for many years with her very French husband, it&#39;s clear that the French truly are singular in the way they live, act, and think--from the lightness of their pastries to the refinement of their Hermes scarves. They simply exude a certain &lt;i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt; that is a veritable art form.  The French revel in the moment, appreciate the time spent in preparing a perfect feast, pay attention to the slightest detail--whether flowers on the table or a knockout accessory on a simple outfit--and work hard when not enjoying their (considerable) leisure time without an ounce of guilt. Their &lt;i&gt;joie de vivre&lt;/i&gt; can come where you least expect it: for the French it&#39;s better to have a &lt;i&gt;chagrin d&#39;amour&lt;/i&gt; than no &lt;i&gt;amour &lt;/i&gt;at all, and for the Frenchman a day without discord is a day without a kick. They have fun (yes, fun !) when they fuss and feud, squabble and shrug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            When it comes to joie de vivre, Harriet is convinced the French are unbeatable.  With good humor and genuine affection for the prickly, paradoxical, and pleasure-seeking Gauls, she takes the reader on her own personal journey through the often byzantine French mindset, sharing tips and tricks such as how to diet like a Frenchwoman and project confidence like a true &lt;i&gt;Parisienne&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her signature warm, witty, and entertaining voice, Harriet shows how joie de vivre permeates the French way of life, precisely because it doesn&#39;t include a &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot; Fortunately, she discovered, you don&#39;t have to &quot;pursue&quot; happiness in France. It pursues you.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Conflict - Resolve It Creatively - Natalie F. Vishnyakova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Conflict - Resolve It Creatively. Practical training
in conflictology, presents a productive creative approach to the
questions of conflictology. The original concept of conflictology is
not only a science over creative decisions of conflicts, but also an art and
practical experience of preventive maintenance and decision of business
and personal conflict situations.
This book represents a picture of life without a conflict, enters
diplomacy of conflictology, shows creative features of psychology of
conflicts, presents stages of internal analysis of a conflict and phases
of its decision as well as it displays educational steps of developing
conflictology methods.
This all-round book guides readers to reach for changes and to use
constructive methods of productive interaction. Developing experience
of the decision of situational and intrapersonal conflicts should allow
anyone to gain new experience on how to solve conflicts and to overcome
their consequences; it should open a more successful internal and frank
occasion of conflicts, to cope with conflict prevention techniques, to
become skilled in controlling art over both external and internal conflicts
and behaviour, and to make use of a reasonable and almost psychological
experience.
The Conflict - Resolve It Creatively is some kind of a treatise on
conflictology with an underlining idea of training and acquisition of new
experience. The author, in the form of a meaningful dialogue, invites the
readers who might be interested, to join her and look into all details and
covert reasons for both destructive and constructive conflicts." />

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Andie Peterson, one of the few women to be awarded an Eagle Feather, has provided a meaningful criteria to help in judging books.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;She writes: On a daily basis, children must face the hidden curriculum that lets them know where they fit in, whether they can achieve their goals, whether they even dare to dream. An overwhelming part of that hidden curriculum begins with books that are more narrative and illustrations; they are books that carry a message of politics and values.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Andie advises that in selecting Native American books, the non-Native child must be considered, also. She counsels that hurtful books set in motion attitudes of prejudice that persist for years. She states that she has reviewed books with older copyrights because they are still on the shelves in libraries and available via the Internet. She says reading the older books helps to understand how adults have formed ideas about Native people. She says: After all, if its in a book in the library, people believe it to be true. Its time to disturb the peace and end the ritual of damage.&lt;/P&gt;

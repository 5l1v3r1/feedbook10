  <title>Hell&#39;s Traces - Victor Ripp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In July 1942, the French police in Paris, acting for the German military government, arrested Victor Ripp&#39;s three-year-old cousin, Alexandre. Two months later, the boy was killed in Auschwitz. In &lt;i&gt;Hell&#39;s Traces&lt;/i&gt;, Ripp examines this act through the prism of family history. In addition to Alexandre, ten members of Ripp&#39;s family on his father&#39;s side died in the Holocaust. His mother&#39;s side of the family, numbering thirty people, was in Berlin when Hitler came to power. Without exception they escaped the Final Solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hell&#39;s Traces &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of the two families&#39; divergent paths. To spark the past to life, he embarks on a journey to visit Holocaust memorials throughout Europe. &quot;Could a stone pillar or a bronze plaque or whatever else constitutes a memorial,&quot; he asks, &quot;cause events that took place more than seven decades ago to appear vivid?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memorial in Warsaw that includes a boxcar like the ones that carried Jews to Auschwitz compels Ripp to contemplate the horror of Alexandre&#39;s transport to his death. One in Berlin that invokes the anti-Jewish laws of the 1930s allows him to better understand how his mother&#39;s family escaped the Nazis. In Paris he stumbles across a playground dedicated to the memory of the French children who were deported, Alexandre among them. Ultimately, Ripp sees thirty-five memorials in six countries. He encounters the artists who designed the memorials, historians who recall the events that are memorialized, and survivors with their own stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolutely unsentimental, &lt;i&gt;Hell&#39;s Traces&lt;/i&gt; is structured like a travelogue in which each destination enables a reckoning with the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />

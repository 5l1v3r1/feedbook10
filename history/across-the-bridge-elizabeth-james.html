  <title>Across the Bridge - Elizabeth James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the continuing story of two men, alike in many ways, who travel far from their native land but are both drawn back to Durham, the spectacular mediaeval city that dominates the northeastern counties of England.  But there is a difference.  Six hundred years separates the lives of the two men.  
Oswald, who has seen action in France and England, is loyal to his King, Edward III, who is also called Plantagenet.  When Oswald sees that the lives of Edward and his son, John of Lancaster (called John of Gaunt by many modern historians), are in jeopardy, he calls to his descendent, James Simpson, for help.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
James Simpson is a scientist of world renown who turns his talents to writing historical fiction.  After returning to his native Durham, he settles into a quiet village hoping to continue his writing.  But when Oswald contacts him, he realizes that they are closer in relationship and behavior that he had believed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Simpson is surprised to find that Oswald is reaching out to him from the past.  He is also surprised that Oswald has a mission for him that requires being transported back into the fourteenth century.  Simpson cannot resist being personally drawn into the mystery.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With the exception of the main fictional characters in the story, the book is a historically accurate account of life in the fourteenth century and the politics that surrounded the throne of England." />

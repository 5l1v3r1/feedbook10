  <title>Futility Ending in Disaster - Gaetano V. Cavallaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As noted in Volume I (The Beginning of Futility) after the Allies had induced Italy to join them against the Central Powers, the Italian Army used the lives of its illiterate peasant fanti as coin advancing to finally endanger Austro-Hungarian defenses.  By August, 1917, Viennas generals were convinced that with German help they had to counterattack while Gen. Eric Ludendorff was wary of giving assistance.  Finally he was  won over after hearing a bold and daring plan later known as blitzkrieg.  Italian Intelligence warnings of an enemy offensive were discarded as it was too late in the year.
     On October 24,1917, Austro-German forces unleashed the first blitzkrieg battle of the century which the Italian Army as the Anglo-French in France in May 1940 could not handle.  Using the four commandments of blitzkrieg (deception, infiltration, isolation , annihilation), they quickly advanced 100 miles through the confused Italian defenses halting at the Piave River and adjacent mountains.  Unable to handle the assault, many disheartened troops had fled, but later, with heroic deeds, halted the enemy advance.  Notwithstanding the great victory, Vienna was negotiating a separate peace with Lloyd George and President Woodrow Wilson both of whom who did not believe the Allies could win." />

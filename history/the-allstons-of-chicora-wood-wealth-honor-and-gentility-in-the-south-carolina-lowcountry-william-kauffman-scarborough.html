  <title>The Allstons of Chicora Wood: Wealth, Honor, and Gentility in the South Carolina Lowcountry - William Kauffman Scarborough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;William Kauffman Scarborough&#39;s absorbing biography, The Allstons of Chicora Wood, chronicles the history of a South Carolina planter family from the opulent antebellum years through the trauma of the Civil War and postwar period. Scarborough&#39;s examination of this extraordinarily enterprising family focuses on patriarch Robert R. F. W. Allston, his wife Adele Petigru Allston, and their daughter Elizabeth Allston Pringle Scarborough. &lt;br&gt;Scarborough shows how Allston, in the four decades before the Civil War, converted a small patrimony into a Lowcountry agricultural empire of seven rice plantations, all the while earning an international reputation for the quality of his rice and his expertise. Scarborough also examines Allston&#39;s twenty-eight-year career in the state legislature and as governor from 1856 to 1858. &lt;br&gt;Upon his death in 1864, Robert Allston&#39;s wife of thirty-two years, Adele, found herself at the head of the family. Scarborough traces how she successfully kept the family plantations afloat in the postwar years through a series of decisions that exhibited her astute business judgment and remarkable strength of character. &lt;br&gt;In the next generation, one of the Allstons&#39; five children followed a similar path. Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Allston took over management of the remaining family plantations upon the death of her husband and, in order to pay off the plantation mortgages, embarked on a highly successful literary career. Bessie authored two books, the first treating her experiences as a woman rice planter and the second describing her childhood before the war. &lt;br&gt;A major contribution to southern history, The Allstons of Chicora Wood provides a fascinating look at a prominent southern family that survived the traumas of war and challenges of Reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine shuffling down Broadway through the hustle and bustle right into the nonstop, neon heart of New York City: 42nd Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a quiet neighborhood of brownstones and churches, the area wastransformed in the early 1900s into an entertainment hub unlike any in theworld. No place has ever evoked the glamour and romantic possibility of bigcity nightlife as vividly as did 42nd Street. It was the dazzle of &quot;naughty, bawdy, gaudy&quot; 42nd Street that put Times Square on the map and turned the Broadway theater district into the Great White Way. &lt;em&gt;Ghosts of 42nd Street&lt;/em&gt; stirs your imagination as it takes you on a historical journey of this glamorized strip still known today as the Crossroads of the World. From the bold innovations of Oscar Hammerstein and Florenz Ziegfeld through the porn-laden 1960s and 1970s to the present-day &quot;Disneyfication&quot; of New York&#39;s bright lights district, &lt;em&gt;Ghosts of 42nd Street&lt;/em&gt; is as fascinating as a tabloid frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;" />

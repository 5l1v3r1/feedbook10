  <title>The Forgotten Ghost Soldiers of Wwii - John A. Eisler Jr., Virginia Foster Eisler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My father would always read to me or tell me stories from a picture book so one day when I was young I asked him to draw me a picture and tell me a war story. 
          I enlisted in the military because these terrible men were trying to hurt my friends and family. They would make them walk on long marches then lock them up like caged animals. They would lock up everyone in their family even the little girls. Being one of the best hunters I was selected to serve on a team with men from other countries and travel all around the world helping free these people.
One time we were dropped off in a little rubber boat to paddle our way to an island during the biggest storm ever. The wind and rain were blowing and the waves made it almost impossible to stay inside the boat. We went in to hunt down the bad guys like Daniel Boone or David Crocket. We were the unknown men with no faces or name tags that silently moved through the night being known for civil war tactics as the advance unit of Ghost Soldiers.
We had to live off of the land eating whatever we could find like berries, fruit, or hunting the animals. We would throw hand grenades into the water that would bring up the snakes, alligators, fish or whatever was living in the water.
The islands were the most beautiful places in the world with all the green plants and the most beautiful flowers and colored birds. 
We freed the people that were taken prisoner and one camp there was a beautiful young girl by the name of Virginia and she is the person I named you after. The dream of someday having a daughter of my own that I could love and protect gave me the willpower needed in combat." />

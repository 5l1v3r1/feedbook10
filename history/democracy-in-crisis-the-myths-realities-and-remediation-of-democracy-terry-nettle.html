  <title>Democracy In Crisis: The Myths, Realities and Remediation of Democracy - Terry Nettle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book traces the many issues that led to the present crisis of confidence in democracy. It examines critically the myths, the realities and the possible ways for the remediation of democracy. Failed policies and failed systems of existing democracies are mainly to blame for this crisis. But the increasing threats of the excesses of capitalism, the biased journalism of the mass media, the often unreliable and unfair yet hugely opinion-influencing polls and surveys, the pervasive and often toxic social media, the disruptive effects of large migrant workforce, self-serving liberalism, rabid racism, rampant individualism, severely radicalized religion, and even youthful anarchy, are all contributing factors of this crisis of confidence. Many examples of these are discussed and analyzed. The need to revamp and reboot democracy is highlighted and a number of important improvements are presented." />

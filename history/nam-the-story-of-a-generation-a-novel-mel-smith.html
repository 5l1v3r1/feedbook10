  <title>NAM: The Story of a Generation (a novel) - Mel Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A riveting, historically accurate tale of war&amp;rsquo;s horror, impossible love, and ultimate redemption. This is the Vietnam generation&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the sixties. We were the baby boomers and our fathers had fought in World War II&amp;mdash;the heroes who saved the world from tyranny. It was our obligation to serve, as they had. To duck service, was not an option; not if you believed in life in America, the American way, and family values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, Cam...I&amp;rsquo;m right about Vietnam and World War II,&amp;rdquo; he said, pointing the two fingers holding his cigarette at me like darts. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d better have a damn good reason to ask a man to put his life on the line &amp;rsquo;cause there&amp;rsquo;s no greater sacrifice he can make. Our fathers had Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo to fight...some of the biggest evil the world has ever known. They really were fighting for freedom and our way of life. Losing wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What did we have?... Huh? What the fuck did we have to fight for? Not a goddamn thing! We went because we were Americans...because we were asked by our country to go...young men always have been. So we went...and we died. That&amp;rsquo;s bravery and sacrifice above and beyond the call, my friend. Dyin&amp;rsquo; for nothin&amp;rsquo;...that&amp;rsquo;s a hell of a thing to ask of a man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NAM, The Story of a Generation &lt;/em&gt;is a tale of times that defined a generation: the counter culture that grew out of it; commitment without conscience; love in impossible circumstances; the unimaginable horror of war; healing hope; and renewal. The Vietnam War is the common thread that binds together the lives and fortunes of the three main characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epic novel about a generation and the conflict that changed two nations.&lt;/p&gt;" />

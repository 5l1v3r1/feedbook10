  <title>Another Sheaf - John Galsworthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Another Sheaf is the second of two such collections of Galsworthy&amp;#39;s wartime work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Galsworthy OM (14 August 1867 &amp;ndash; 31 January 1933) was an English novelist and playwright. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906&amp;ndash;1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Galsworthy was born at what is now known as Galsworthy House (then called Parkhurst) on Kingston Hill in Surrey, England, the son of John and Blanche Bailey (n&amp;eacute;e Bartleet) Galsworthy. His family was prosperous and well established, with a large property in Kingston upon Thames that is now the site of three schools: Marymount International School, Rokeby Preparatory School, and Holy Cross Preparatory School. He attended Harrow and New College, Oxford. He took a Second in Law (Jurisprudentia) at Oxford in 1889, then trained as a barrister and was called to the bar in 1890. However, he was not keen to begin practising law and instead travelled abroad to look after the family&amp;#39;s shipping business. During these travels he met Joseph Conrad, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbour of Adelaide, Australia, and the two future novelists became close friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper (1864&amp;ndash;1956), the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. After her divorce ten years later, they were married on 23 September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933. Before their marriage, they often stayed clandestinely in a farmhouse called Wingstone in the village of Manaton on Dartmoor, Devon. In 1908 Galsworthy took a long lease on part of the building and it was their regular second home until 1923." />

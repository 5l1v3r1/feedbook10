  <title>From Crockett to Custer - Mike Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Two legendary battles which sprang from the depths of history to shine as symbols of self sacrifice, heroism and glorious defeat. Encounters which took the lives of two of America&#39;s most famous figures: Davy Crockett and General Custer.
&lt;P&gt;
What is the essential link between the battles of the Alamo and the Little Bighorn? Why did Crockett choose to leave a safe political career to throw in his lot with suicidal adventurers? What drove Custer to ignore common sense and ride to certain death? How could it be that the defenders of the Alamo were made up largely of lawyers and doctors? Or that the troopers of the 7th Cavalry numbered a majority of Irishmen and Germans? Did you know that Crockett kept his besieged comrades entertained with fiddle tunes or that Custer&#39;s devoted wife may have had a romantic fling with one of her husband&#39;s officers?
&lt;P&gt;
These are just a few of the many questions answered by this new book which explores connections between these events. For the first time, the battles are linked, exploring reasons, causes, outcomes and personalities. Basing his viewpoint on years of research and travelling across the relevant areas of the USA, the author gives a detailed account which is accessible to anyone coming to the subject for the first time. Illustrated with the author&#39;s own photographs, maps and sketches, &quot;From Crockett to Custer&quot; takes the reader on an informative journey through the battlefields as they were and as they are today.
&lt;P&gt;
An ideal introduction to the battles of the Alamo and Little Bighorn which will give a true understanding of what happened and the legacy which remains." />

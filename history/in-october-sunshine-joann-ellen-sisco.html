  <title>In October Sunshine - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many circumstances had combined to shape the direction of Sadies life.
From the early death of her father, to the social customs of the period, many avenues were blocked to a young female, but an intelligent, inventive lady of any age could find her way around many of them. For a time, Sadie allowed herself to be pushed into place to fill an existing vacancy. The pushing was gently and lovingly done, but she was pushed, nevertheless, and the pushing seemed acceptable.
Her life moved along for decades in much the same way, and then came the time that her eyes were opened and she was determined to be pushed no longer. From here on, for the rest of her life, she would set the direction her mind and feet would take. Like a bird, she would rise and take flight
&lt;p&gt; FROM GUNSHOT TO HOMESTEAD is book one of an eight book series, DEEP FORK RIVER, OKLAHOMA TERRITORY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This series took place in a unique period of history when new land was deeded on the basis of a gunshot and a footrace. The central nugget of land in the Oklahoma Territory was advertised for settlement, quarter sections were marked out and on the 22 of April, l889 the local Cavalry and other officials started the race at the shot of a gun. On foot... on horses in wagons and in buggies, they struggled for a place to put down roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Each of these books brings a different family, person, or in one incident, a whole town to settle in the new land. The small town fictional town of Prosper was settled by these immigrants and others. It is generally thought that this incident was the only one of its kind in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book one. FROM GUNSHOT TO HOMKESTEAD. A 22 year old young lady and her father make a night flight to protect a small girl from kidnap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book two. UNDER THE REDBUDS. An idea born in a Nebraska storm gives birth to a snowball of activity for half a town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book three. TREK THROUGH THE WILDERNESS. A young Kentucky preacher follows a strange guide with the help of a strong young lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book four. OF BOOMERS AND SOONERS. Free land was passed out, but some of it was already occupied. A man does what he had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book five. IN OCTOBER SUNSHINE. The lady, no longer young, realized she permitted herself to be a follower all her life. It was not her time to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book six. BEHIND EVERY CLOUD. Young victim of circumstances feels she finally deserves a silver lining, if she can just turn that cloud around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book seven. TO THE PROMISED LAND. Young Camille experiences what no girl should experience, but some things happen in the best families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book eight. WITH A SONG IN THE NIGHT. Two young girls who have never met are thrown together in desperate circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Inside the World of Mirrors - J. Max Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the unseen Shadow War that occurred between 1968 and 1976. It was written to honor those who served our country and didnt come back. They may have been ignored or denied by the Powers That Be, but they will live in my heart and my nightmares as long as I live. The profits from the sale of this book will go to help homeless veterans. 
Reading this book will open a new world for you -- The world of Special Intelligence Operations. From Viet Nam to Cambodia to Laos and North Viet Nam the action will show you why so many veterans from the Viet Nam War have PTSD. The potential for recurring nightmares will be apparent. Next you will take a trip from Libya to Spain to Italy and Romania. You will find out that the war against terror did not start in 2001. 
The following sample will demonstrate what 
Inside the 
World of Mirrors 
is all about. 
In 1974, I met and was briefed by a Mr. Martin, a high level individual from the American Embassy in Rome, Italy, on an operation to insure that a particular individual would not continue funding communist political activities in Italy. He was a bag man for the KGB. It was less than two months until a very important election was to take place. He was spreading money around to help the communist political candidates get elected. I was simply told Make Him Stop! They gave me carte blanche to get it done. Anytime in the next seven days would be just fine. This was only one of the 83 missions ran by a Special Intelligence Operative code named the 
Iceman" />

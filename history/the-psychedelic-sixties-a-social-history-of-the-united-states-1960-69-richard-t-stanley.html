  <title>The Psychedelic Sixties: a Social History of the United States, 1960-69 - Richard T. Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Psychedelic Sixties were turbulent times filled with periods of ecstasy and despair. Who could have predicted that President Kennedy&#39;s Camelot would end with his televised assassination? Or that Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary&#39;s &quot;Concord Prison Project&quot; would evolve into his becoming the pied piper of LSD, the Psychedelic Revolution, and the Hippie Movement? To the credit of many Americans, a key characteristic of the Psychedelic Sixties was the search for solutions to society&#39;s social problems. But who could have predicted that President Johnson&#39;s &quot;Great Society&quot; would soon fall victim to race riots, student protests, and an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the sixties, regular folks tried to find relief by watching TV comedies, motion picture musicals, and major sports events. And music --- from The Beatles to The Rolling Stones. Despite all the decade&#39;s chaos and bloodshed, public and private schools at all levels grew at unprecedented rates. And corporate America and our schools were more in cahoots than ever: &quot;Want a good job? Get a college degree!&quot; And, in 1969, as some Hippies still exclaimed, &quot;Tune in, turn on, drop out!&quot;, an American named Neil Armstrong WALKED ON THE MOON!&lt;/p&gt;" />

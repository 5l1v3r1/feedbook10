The secret air raid against the hydroelectric dams of Germany&amp;#8217;s Ruhr River took years to plan, involved an untried bomb and included the best aircrewmen RAF Bomber Command could muster&amp;#8212;many of them Canadian. The attack marked the first time the Allies tactically took the war inside Nazi Germany. It was a military operation that became legendary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers carrying 133 airmen took off on a night sortie code-named Operation Chastise. Hand-picked and specially trained, the Lancaster crews flew at treetop level to the industrial heartland of the Third Reich and their targets&amp;#8212;the Ruhr River dams, whose massive water reservoirs powered Nazi Germany&amp;#8217;s military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Lancaster carried an explosive, which when released just sixty feet over the reservoirs, bounced like a skipping stone to the dam, sank and exploded. The raiders breached two dams and damaged a third. The resulting torrent devastated enemy power plants, factories and infrastructure a hundred miles downstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every airmen on the raid understood that the odds of survival were low. Of the nineteen outbound bombers, eight did not return. Operation Chastise cost the lives of fifty-three airmen, including fourteen Canadians. Of the sixteen RCAF men who survived, seven received military decorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on interviews, personal accounts, flight logs, maps and photographs of the Canadians involved, &lt;em&gt;Dam Busters&lt;/em&gt; recounts the dramatic story of these young Commonwealth bomber crews tasked with a high-risk mission against an enemy prepared to defend the Fatherland to the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />

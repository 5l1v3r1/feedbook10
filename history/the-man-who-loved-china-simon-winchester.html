  <title>The Man Who Loved China - Simon Winchester</title>

In 1937, while working as a biochemist at Cambridge University, he instantly fell in love with a visiting Chinese student, with whom he began a lifelong affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon became fascinated with China, and his mistress swiftly persuaded the ever-enthusiastic Needham to travel to her home country, where he embarked on a series of extraordinary expeditions to the farthest frontiers of this ancient empire.

His thrilling and dangerous journeys, vividly recreated by Winchester, took him across war-torn China to far-flung outposts, consolidating his deep admiration for the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the war, Needham was determined to tell the world what he had discovered, and began writing his majestic&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Science and Civilisation in China&lt;/em&gt;, describing the country&#39;s long and astonishing history of invention and technology. By the time he died, he had produced, essentially single-handedly, seventeen immense volumes, marking him as the greatest one-man encyclopedist ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both epic and intimate,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Man Who Loved China&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;tells the sweeping story of China through Needham&#39;s remarkable life.

  <title>Custom, Kinship, and Gifts to Saints - Stephen D. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="White combines an intensive study of medieval law with insights from anthropology, religion, and social history to create a picture of French society in the Middle Ages which is impressive in its breadth and illuminating in its detail. By examining the practice whereby gifts of land were approved by the giver&#39;s relatives, he suggests novel ways of looking at early medieval law, kinship, land tenure, and gift exchange. White shows that &lt;i&gt;laudatio parentum&lt;/i&gt; can be properly analyzed only within a combined social, legal, and religious context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

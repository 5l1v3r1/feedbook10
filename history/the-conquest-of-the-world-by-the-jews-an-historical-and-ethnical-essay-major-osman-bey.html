  <title>The Conquest of the World By the Jews: An Historical and Ethnical Essay - Major Osman Bey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Conquest of the World by the Jews was originally published in 1873 as &quot;La conque?te du monde par les Juifs&quot; by Major Osman Bey (real name Frederick Millingen). The English translation was first published in 1878 and became a worldwide bestseller. In this new version, the original text has been edited and the foreword places it in its historical context.
From the Foreword of the 1976 edition &quot;There has been nothing written during the past 200 years to compare with what you are about to read. In fact, we doubt that anything ever written can compare with the contents contained herein because this is the only work which has revealed the result of the principle of material interests. The author says: “The Jewish people have, in all probability, been the ?rst ones to discover that secret power-the principle of material interests.&quot; Every non—Jew must read this book because only then will he discover how The Principle of Material Interests enslaves people by financial oppression.&quot;" />

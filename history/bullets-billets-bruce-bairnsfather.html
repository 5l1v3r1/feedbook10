  <title>Bullets &amp; Billets - Bruce Bairnsfather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has been commented that it can only be hoped that Bruce Bairnsfather comes to receive more of the recognition he so richly deserves.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Bullets and Billets&amp;#39; describes his service with the machine gun section of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment during the early part of the First World War (including a fascinating account of the famous Christmas Truce of 1914) up to his participation in the Battle of Ypres during which he was wounded and subsequently evacuated to Blighty. The language used is typical of the period and shows the light hearted approach to warfare that personified the British Tommy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On second reading however the early signs of &amp;#39;shell shock&amp;#39; that were to result in Bairnsfather&amp;#39;s return to Britain can be discerned - it speaks volumes for men such as BB who quietly and cheerily went about their duty whilst suffering inner torment. Running as a theme throughout this account (quite apart from the seemingly non stop rain !) is how BB used his artistic skill to capture some of the more humorous aspects of Tommy&amp;#39;s war whenever time, the weather and the opposing German forces allowed. It was his undoubted merit as a cartoonist that was to ensure his fame." />

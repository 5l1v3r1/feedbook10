  <title>A Notorious Woman: Anne Royall in Jacksonian America - Elizabeth J. Clapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her long career as a public figure in Jacksonian America, Anne     Royall was called everything from an &quot;enemy of religion&quot; to a &quot;Jackson man&quot;     to a &quot;common scold.&quot; In her search for the source of such strong reactions, Elizabeth     Clapp has uncovered the story of a widely read woman of letters who asserted her right to a     political voice without regard to her gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Widowed and in need of a     livelihood following a disastrous lawsuit over her husband&#39;s will, Royall decided to earn     her living through writing--first as a travel writer, journeying through America to research and     sell her books, and later as a journalist and editor. Her language and forcefully expressed     opinions provoked people at least as much as did her inflammatory behavior and aggressive     marketing tactics. An ardent defender of American liberties, she attacked the agents of     evangelical revivals, the Bank of the United States, and corruption in government. Her positions     were frequently extreme, directly challenging the would-be shapers of the early republic&#39;s     religious and political culture. She made many enemies, but because she also attracted many     supporters, she was not easily silenced. The definitive account of a passionate voice when     America was inventing itself, &lt;i&gt;A Notorious Woman&lt;/i&gt; re-creates a fascinating     stage on which women&#39;s roles, evangelical hegemony, and political involvement were all     contested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

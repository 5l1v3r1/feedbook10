  <title>Discover the Lost Coast - V. Catania-Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awake each morning to the silence made by a moist fog lying down upon the shores of the coast. By noon the sun has come out and sea birds are at work flying above the many fishermen out on the water trying their luck. Seal, Whales, an occasional walrus, or sea otter can be seen frolicking tot far from the shore. The tidal pools are some of the richest in all of California. In 1924, the McArthurs discovered Shelter Cove. For the next thirty-eight years their children and grandchildren spent their summers at the ranch, meeting each day with expectations of yet another adventure. Never were they disappointed. Though the scenery has changed, The Lost Coast is still an exciting wilderness. The mountains jut straight up from the Pacific Ocean making travel difficult. There are few roads. The Black Sands Beach is known for its wild beauty. If you choose to go hiking or camping inland, be prepared to encounter a badger, a California condor, or a golden eagle along with the many other kinds of birds. Dont be surprised to discover youll want to come back every summer after that! Join two little girls with the Sausage Curls who tell you their story and discover the Lost Coast." />

With this paper craft book, some card stock paper, and a hobby knife, anyone can build spectacular re-creation&#39;s of the most famous buildings in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Based on the extraordinary models of world-renowned papercrafter, and origami artist Yee, whose own remarkable origami recreations of these very same models sell for thousands of dollars, these paper replicas are nearly as impressive as the original buildings.  Yee provides detailed instructions on how to cut and assemble these architectural landmarks from around the world.  Yee even engineered half of these designs so they could be assembled without having to use glue.  The origami projects have a range of difficulty levels, from the relatively easy (Arc d&#39;Triomphe) to the impressively sophisticated and intricate (The Tower Bridge).  Once the structure is attached to the base not only will does it look amazing, but it can be folded up and taken anywhere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;This origami book includes:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Over 900 photographs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Full-color instructional assembly diagrams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Brief histories of each building&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Downloadable CD content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>American Resolve and the Art of War - John Proctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the end of World War II, Americans realized that the only way to keep America out of war is to keep the world out of war. Americans also realize that today their country is the leader of the Western World if not the whole world... The leadership role was thrust upon the United States when its traditional allies are weak. Thus, all decisions made by the United States must also be implemented by the United States. 
A Chinese general said, Ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle but defeating the enemy without ever fighting. This should be Americas goal, but it seems that this can only be achieved with a large standing army. However, there is an alternative. This goal can be achieved with a strong, disciplined reserve force which will cost only a fraction of a large standing army. The reserve force should be trained to implement skillful and innovative tactics. Excellent training will also accomplish another significant goal: minimize American casualties." />

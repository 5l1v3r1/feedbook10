  <title>Economic War Circle - Samantha Pague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The crash of the world stock markets and the largest transfer of wealth ever had been perpetrated by sophisticated computer hackers. They had worked on the Central Banking Systems highest level security systems and were able to unlink the dark fiber in the internal security centers then detonated a series of electromagnetic pulse bombs to hide their tracks. This created monetary chaos in the EU and resulted in the US stock market nosediving into a crash. As a result, the entire worlds debt was being ordered to be repaid through a tribunal court that was the first of its kind. War debts from World War II were still outstanding, never having been paid back to the US; and now the US and the EU are working on a way to collect on all of the outstanding IOUs, along with all of the unpaid taxes, in order to balance the books. Assets purchased with hacked Central Banking System Euros were being confiscated to help repay all outstanding debts and reconcile the books to restore lost value to the International Monetary Fund and the EU and US economies. That included all international debt, national debt, and consumer debt, and a notice to quit had been sent by certified mail to all those whose accounts had been compromised." />

  <title>Parallel Lines - Nader Rizk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Out of love for this country, this book has been written. It hurts to see the country go down or dragged in the mud. JFK said, Dont ask what your country can do for you but ask what can you do for your country. This quote is appropriate in this book because this book deals with the present situation and the state the country is in these days. Someone has to point out what is wrong and how to correct the mistakes that were made. Politicians are blind or act dumb for a reason or another. We have to liberate ourselves from the personal desires and look for the common good of the nation. Once we reach this stage, everything will run smoothly, everybody will be happy, and heaven will give its blessing.
This book is written in a way that grabs the attention of any inquisitive mind. It has some unfamiliar names, but the reader might find it interesting to decipher these names. This is not the only point; it is written to engage the reader in a dialogue. It is not a statement to be read, but there are many questions to be answered. The writer does not answer these questions; he wants the citizens to find the answers to these questions. When the people find the answers, they can connect the dots. When you connect these dots, you will find the clear picture. Once you get the picture, you can see where the writer wants you to be. As you try to answer these questions, have an open mind and do not restrict yourself to one answer, but find all possible answers. Put these answers in front of you, and choose the most logical answer regardless of your political views or association to any political party. If you liberated yourself from your commitment to a certain political view, you will be capable of making the right judgment. 
There are some warnings; it is not my warnings but heavenly ones, to correct our directions and try to do the right things. It will show the reader some of the incidents in the history of mankind on earth and how heaven dealt with man when he violated the heavenly laws.
The natural laws do not change. These laws have been in existence since the beginning of this universe. Our ignorance of these laws is not an excuse." />

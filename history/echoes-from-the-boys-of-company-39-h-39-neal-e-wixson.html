  <title>Echoes from the Boys of Company &#39;H&#39; - Neal E. Wixson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Echoes from the Boys of Company H focuses on a few Civil War soldiers from Company H, 100th Regiment, New York State Volunteers, who were prolific writers. It is based upon a treasure trove of hundreds of letters, journals, and diaries. These writings provide rare insight into life as a common soldier. The boys also share their thoughts about topics ranging from everyday camp life and homesickness to broader concerns such as politics and religion. Hear a firsthand account of the horrors of prison life in Andersonville, Ga.&lt;p&gt;
Follow these soldiers after the war as they re-enter civil life. As their experiences begin to fade to distant echoes from the past, the soldiers ultimately join together to develop an association to relive and glorify their wartime experiences.&lt;p&gt; 
Echoes from the Boys of Company H is a unique and touching collection of the written words of young men who proudly served their country during one of the most tumultuous times in the young nations history. Although their voices are now silenced, the documents they left behind are eloquent lessons in the understanding of and gratitude for the sacrifices of all who fought on both sides.&lt;p&gt;
Here is a rich collection of Civil War letters. They reveal the emotions and actions of men in battle. Edward Longacre, Author of Army of Amateurs&lt;p&gt;
An unusually textured view of the Civil War and its immediate aftermath in the words of its participants. The editor has gone to tremendous lengths to locate and transcribe a vast array of viewpoints on battles, camp life and wartime politics. Professor Carol Sheriff and co-author of A People at War&lt;p&gt;
Stunning! A remarkable tour de force! This is an intimate, personal look into everyday life in the 100th New York Infantry. We endure the misery of diseases and trench warfare, the boredom of camp life, and the terror of battles with these soldiers. Jeff Toalson, editor of No Soap, No Pay, Diarrhea, Dysentery &amp; Desertion." />

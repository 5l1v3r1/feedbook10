  <title>With the Heart of a King - Benton Rain Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Philip II of Spain, the most powerful monarch in sixteenth-century Europe and a ferocious empire-builder, was matched against the dauntless queen of England, Elizabeth I, determined to defend her country and thwart Philip&#39;s ambitions.  Philip had been king of England while married to Elizabeth&#39;s half-sister, Bloody Mary Tudor, a devout Catholic.  After Mary&#39;s untimely death, he courted Elizabeth, the new queen, and proposed marriage to her, hoping to build a permanent alliance between his country and hers and return England to the Catholic fold.  Lukewarm to the Spanish alliance and resolute against a counterreformation, Elizabeth declined his proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When under her guidance England&#39;s maritime power grew to challenge Spain&#39;s rule of the sea and threaten its rich commerce, Philip became obsessed with the idea of a conquest of England and the restoration of Catholicism there, by fire and sword.  Elizabeth--bold, brilliant, defiantly Protestant--became his worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1586 Philip began assembling the mighty Spanish Armada, and in May 1588 it sailed from Lisbon.  With superior seamanship and strategies, Elizabeth&#39;s navy defeated and drove off the Spanish fleet.  Forced to retreat around the northern coast of Ireland and Scotland, Philip&#39;s ships ran into violent storms that wreaked havoc.  It was the rivalry&#39;s climactic event.&lt;/p&gt;" />

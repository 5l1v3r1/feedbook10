  <title>Journey to the Wilderness: War, Memory and a Southern Family&#39;s Civil War Letters - Frye Gaillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the Civil War, award-winning author Frye Gaillard reflects on the war -- and the way we remember it -- through letters written by his family, including his great-great grandfather and his two sons, both of whom were Confederate officers. As Gaillard explains in his introductory essay, he came of age in a Southern generation that viewed the war as a glorious lost cause. But as he read through letters collected by members of his family, he confronted a far more sobering truth.  &quot;Oh, this terrible war,&quot; wrote his great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gaillard. &quot;Who can measure the troubles -- the affliction -- it has brought upon us all?&quot;  To this real-time anguish in voices from the past, Gaillard offers a personal remembrance of the shadow of war and its place in the haunted identity of the South. &quot;My own generation,&quot; he writes, &quot;was, perhaps, the last that was raised on stories of gallantry and courage . . . Oddly, mine was also the one of the first generations to view the Civil War through the lens of civil rights -- to see . . . connections and flaws in Southern history that earlier generations couldn&#39;t bear to face.&quot;" />

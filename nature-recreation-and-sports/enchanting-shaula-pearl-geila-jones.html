  <title>Enchanting Shaula Pearl - Geila Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Geila takes you on a wild and incredible journey of love, joy, and healing, and straight into the heart and soul of Shaula Pearl, who survived a horrific existence of abuse and neglect. To truly enchant her, it took the magic of belief, a fearless enchantment plan, and support from the angelic realms, opening doorways to the spirit world. The luminous glow of divine guidance poured in, helping Shaula Pearl rise above her most frightening memories. Within a year, she was no longer stiff and afraid of everything, crammed into a small closet. Also, she found joy. It manifested in such an amazing and unexpected way, it leaves you in awe of the divine power of love and the value of all journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaula Pearl glows with spiritual messages, reminding us that all souls deserve their joyful inheritance, that it doesnt matter who we love, but that we love, and that animals are highly respected on the other side. Shaula Pearl knows that now, embracing her self-worth, linking her to the sacredness of her own soul. She claimed her inner-dog goddess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Geilas own innate psychic abilities flourished. When you connect passionately with a soul who feels hopeless, and you love without conditions, you call in your angels, guides, and even your deceased dogs, with their own brand of enchantment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enchanting Shaula Pearl&lt;/i&gt; takes you beyond a rescue story, into the realms of spirit, where all things are imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;" />

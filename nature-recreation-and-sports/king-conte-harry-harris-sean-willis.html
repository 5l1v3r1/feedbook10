  <title>King Conte - Harry Harris, Sean Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="King Conte, the sensational story of how Antonio Conte won the Premier League as manager of Chelsea in his first season in charge, is being rush released by G2 Entertainment just days after the club attempt to do the Double in the FA Cup Final against Arsenal on Saturday, May 27. Written by legendary soccer scribe Harry Harris, with a foreword by Ron &#39;Chopper&#39; Harris, the club&#39;s longest serving player, the illustrated blockbuster takes the reader through every match of the season and shows how Conte radically changed the formation from a flat back four to a five-man defence with three centre-backs and two wing halves that changed Chelsea&#39;s season around. He turned journeymen footballers such as Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso into versatile attacking wing backs while transforming David Luiz from a wayward defender into a risk free stalwart between the ever-reliable defenders Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta. N&#39;Golo Kante, the PFA Player of the Year, hardly had a bad game as the lynch pin in midfield while Nemanja Matic found the majestic form that had deserted him last season. Eden Hazard, the dazzling dribbler, confirmed his reputation as one of the top players in the world, while Diego Costa and Pedro completed an attacking trio that helped the team score more goals and win more matches that any other in the Premiership this season. But it was Conte whose tactical genius ensured that the players worked as a team and maybe not blessed with such superstar players as Drogba, Lampard, Terry and Cech, they are arguably the best collective in the history of the club - as this book ably and thrillingly demonstrates." />

  <title>Hygge Knits - Nicki Trench</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It seems that suddenly everyone wants to be Scandinavian, and hearing about the Danish concept of hygge has made us all think about how we can bring more warmth and friendship into our lives. One way to spread the love, and keep things cozy, is to knit yourself – or your family – a warm and beautiful sweater, hat, gloves or socks, with a Scandinavian feel.
From Shetland to the Faroe Islands, Norway and beyond, there is a shared tradition of knitting intricate patterns in colours that combine and contrast. Whether you have been inspired by watching Danish dramas or you are fascinated by the intricate geometric patterns of Fair Isle, there are designs here that will make you want to pick up your needles and get knitting. Garments include a tank top with a vintage feel, an adorable cardigan for a baby, and a Nordic-style yoked sweater. For the home, there’s a cafetiere cosy, a chunky cushion cover, and more. There’s also a baby blanket that would make a perfect gift, and a lined cover for your e-reader. With full colour charts for all patterns, and a techniques section to explain essential Fair-Isle knitting skills, you will have everything you need to know. (Previously published as Fair Isle and Nordic Knits.)" />

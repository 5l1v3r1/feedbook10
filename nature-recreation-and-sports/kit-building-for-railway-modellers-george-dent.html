  <title>Kit Building for Railway Modellers - George Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Locomotive kit building remains the best route to achieving a varied range of motive power in most scales but it also retains a mystique, being associated with expert modellers and expensive tools. However, in this invaluable, richly illustrated volume, George Dent demonstrates how anyone can successfully assemble working kits with only a modicum of inexpensive equipment and experience. All aspects of assembly are covered in detail including working in plastics, resin and metal; the very basics of working and joining materials; installing ready-made power units and performing more complex operations, such as assembling etched metal chassis frames and intricate valve gear. Includes a full guide to essential tools, materials and adhesives, covers the art of soldering and explains the basics behind chassis construction and alignment. Presents an in-depth guide to the assembly of cylinders, coupling rods and valve gear and examines a range of power unit and transmission options. Demonstrates how to detail and modify kits for extra realism, illustrates painting, lining and weathering techniques and offers tips on running-in, testing and maintaining mechanisms. An essential guide to building locomotives and multiple units from kits and helps the modeller to achieve the best results from every kit. Aimed at railway modellers of all abilities, it is superbly illustrated with 537 colour photographs." />

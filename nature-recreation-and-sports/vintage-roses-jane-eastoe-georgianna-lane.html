  <title>Vintage Roses - Jane Eastoe, Georgianna Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The focus of this book is on the classic, ageless, and enduring flowers, which 
we have dubbed Vintage roses. This user-friendly term encompasses both the true Old roses and the best of the Modern roses. All Vintage roses have one thing in common; they are garden-friendly roses that celebrate the style and grace of the old.
Vintage roses can be overblown, multi-petalled or deliciously simple, and this sumptuous tome is a love letter to these beautiful blooms. Unearth the hands-on know-how and history of the world&#39;s favourite flower. This book will appeal to the armchair gardener, gardening novice and seasoned expert alike.
At the heart of the book are over 60 specially selected specimens – including those that have the best visual appearance, the most fragrant perfume, are easy to grow and produce beautiful flowers for cutting. The book covers not just original varieties such as Rosa Mundi (with its beautifully variegated stripes of deep pink and white), but also the wonderful new varieties that have been developed over the last 20 years. 
The no-fuss notes on pruning and care and the straightforward advice that accompanies each variety completely dispel the myth that roses are difficult or time-consuming to grow – proving that you can just as easily grow roses in a pot on your front steps as you can in a large country garden. Covering the best rambling, climbing and shrub roses, from bourbon to tea and floribunda to polyantha, you’ll be sure to find your new favourite variety. Plus, tips and tricks on arranging your cut roses makes it even easier to enjoy these fabulous flowers at home.
With contemporary commentary on each bloom, easy-to-follow advice and glorious photography, this book will appeal to everyone who appreciates the classic beauty of the vintage rose." />

  <title>Ultimate Knit Stitch Bible - Collins &amp; Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This jam-packed stitch bible begins with a guide to the best tools and equipment, detailed instructions on how to knit, and information on reading stitch diagrams and understanding knitting abbreviations. The stitches are divided into five sections. The first section introduces basic combinations of knit and purl. These two basic stitches can be configured into patterns and constructed into all kinds of fabrics. The second section features cable and aran stiches. These are characterized by a large central panel bordered by varying numbers of side panels on a textural background. For the beginner knitter, lace knitting may seem daunting as it requires a little more technique. However, the sense of accomplishing a simple eyelet will encourage you to attempt and experiment with the more complex and challenging effects. The fourth section focuses on colourwork, with most of the designs drawing inspiration from traditional Scottish and Scandinavian patterns knitted using the Fair Isle technique, which uses design repeats and motifs in horizontal and vertical bands, and in small and large panels. Intarsia knitting is a similar technique, though patterns often involve larger blocks of colour and picture motifs. The final section concentrates on edgings and trims. From simple yet decorative ribs to intricate lace borders, there is an almost endless variety of edgings. They offer a quick way of turning a plain knit garment into something supremely stylish. Whether you’re a knitting novice who is picking up a pair of needles for the first time, or a seasoned professional with years of experience, you will find inspiration and technical know-how within these pages." />

  <title>Clockmaking in England and Wales in the Twentieth Century - John Glanville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over a decade John Glanville and Bill Wolmuth undertook an important horological project for the British Museum. This involved establishing a representative collection, for the Museum, of twentieth-century domestic mechanical clocks made in England and Wales using industrialized manufacturing methods. This remarkable book is the culmination of their efforts. Wide-ranging in its coverage, it will be a key reference tool for horologists, horoligical students, collectors, and antiques and clock dealers. It provides a comprehensive history of each significant manufacturer, including the principal people involved and covers the various mechanical clock movements that were produced. Previously unpublished research about the manufacturers, the clocks they made and the dates when they were manufactured is presented. Finally, this book informs readers how they can identify and date almost all of the clocks they are likely to encounter. This detailed and meticulously researched book on the domestic mechanical clocks made in England and Wales in the twentieth century, a culmination of ten years&#39; research by the authors, will be a key reference tool for horologists, horological students, collectors, and clock and antiques dealers. Superbly illustrated with 1016 colour photographs and period black and white illustrations." />

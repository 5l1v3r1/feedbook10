  <title>Charlie Bear - B.J. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When B.J. Taylor first read about rescue dog Charlie Bear, she gazed at his photograph and knew right away he was the dog for her. She just hoped her husband, Roger, would agree. Thankfully, he did, and in the subsequent year, both B.J. and Roger soon discovered that Charlie Bear was brought into their world for a very special reasonto teach them about life, love, and second chances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Bear shares an intimate look at the first year in the life of a dog nearly labeled unadoptable by his foster mother due to his long list of behavioral issues. As he begins his new life, Charlie Bear ferociously guards his food and toys, throws temper tantrums, and is sensitive to touch. Although B.J. doubts their sanity in adopting Charlie Bear after he repeatedly attacks their other dog, Rex, she is determined to make it work for the sake of her husband, who has fallen in love. But when B.J.s world begins to fall apart, she shares how time, patience, and faith helped her realize that Charlie Bear was not the only one who needed a second chanceshe did, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Bear offers a loving tribute to a rescue dog that eventually sheds his headstrong ways, becomes a loving member of a family, and ultimately changes three lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;

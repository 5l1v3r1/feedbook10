  <title>Bisexual David - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David is a bisexual married man, whose wife either doesn&amp;#39;t know about his gay side or doesn&amp;#39;t care. This book is mostly about his adventures with other men, whom he meets in a variety of ways and places. The descriptions of his sexual activities are explicit and detailed, so the book is for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;quot;David at the Movie Theater&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From time to time, when David has nothing better to do, he will go to find some action in the seedier part of town. This is the place where the porno book stores and movie houses are located, along with some live, and very lively, entertainment. His favorite place is the Carnal Club Bookstore but if there is nothing happening there, he will go across the street to The Tea Room Movie Theater. As its name implies, the theater shows all gay movies. David is not a fan of the movie genre. To him, all the actors are either thuggish louts or swishy poufs, and he can&amp;#39;t identify with either kind. He goes there in hopes of finding somebody who wants some quick and easy sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last occasion when David patronized The Tea Room, after handing over his ten dollars to the man in the admissions window, he approached a door with a big warning sign in red letters on a white background. The sign said: &amp;quot;WARNING!&amp;nbsp; DO NOT ENTER UNLESS YOU ARE AT LEAST 18YEARS OLD. INSIDE THIS MOVIE THEATER YOU WILL SEE ACTS OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE ON THE SCREEN, ON THE STAGE OR AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE. IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY SUCH SEX ACTS, DO NOT ENTER!&amp;nbsp; Since David did not believe that such sex acts, whether depicted on the screen or live would be offensive to him, he went through the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The interior was extremely dark and David had to wait several minutes for his eyes to adjust. When he could see well enough he started moving slowly down the aisle. Here and there, a few men were sucking off other men but that didn&amp;#39;t interest David. He was there to do, not watch. Other men were sitting by themselves and David stood next to the aisle seat of the row where one of them, who looked to be in his early forties, was occupying the next chair in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the man noticed David, he patted the cushion next to himself and David responded to the invitation by sitting there." />

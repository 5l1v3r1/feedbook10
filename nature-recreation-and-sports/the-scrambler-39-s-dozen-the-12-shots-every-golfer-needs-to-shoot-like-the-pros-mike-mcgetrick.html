  <title>The Scrambler&#39;s Dozen: The 12 shots every Golfer Needs to Shoot Like the Pros - Mike Mcgetrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this invaluable book, Mike McGetrick, one of &lt;em&gt;Golf&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&#39;s Top 100 Teaching Professionals in America and 1999 National PGA Teacher of the Year, shows how to make the best shot possible and shave strokes off your game. Sharing the same methods he uses when coaching some of the best players in the world, McGetrick outlines 12 basic shots you can incorporate into your game without overhauling your technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shotmaking is much more than simply curving the ball or hitting it low and high,&quot; explains Mike McGetrick, personal instructor to top golf professionals such as Juli Inkster, Brandt Jobe, and Meg Mallon. &quot;It&#39;s understanding how the lie, the wind, the contour of the target and the hazards of the course will affect your decision making process.&quot; To reach full scoring potential on a course, you have to be a scrambler at heart, a master who can read a course&#39;s shifting challenges-from weather and terrain to pin positions-and adapt accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the clear advice in The Scrambler&#39;s Dozen, you will learn to be a great scrambler-to trust your decisions and your ability to execute shots to get the greatest rewards from the game. Like the pros, you too can learn when and how to chip or pitch or putt from off the green, and know how to practice so you&#39;re rarely in unfamiliar situations on the golf course. The Scramblers Dozen is the secret for squeezing every ounce out of your game and reaching your full scoring potential.&lt;/p&gt;" />

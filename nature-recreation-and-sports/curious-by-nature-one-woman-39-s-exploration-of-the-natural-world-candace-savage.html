  <title>Curious by Nature: One Woman&#39;s Exploration of the Natural World - Candace Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The survival of wildlife on this planet depends on animals&#39; relationships with the people who share their natural habitat and influence its management. Nature writer &lt;B&gt;Candace Savage&lt;/B&gt; has spent the last 25 years exploring humankind&#39;s complex relationships with the natural world. This thoughtful collection showcases Savage&#39;s exploration of the varied ways people relate to wildlife, from retelling fairytales about the big, bad wolf; to being surprised by the intellectual capacity of crows; to struggling to find a balance between harvesting trees and allowing grizzly bears the space to roam. Savage is particularly interested in bridging the gap between mythology and science. A constructive approach to the human-wildlife relationship, she says, lies in integrating reason and emotion and recognizing people&#39;s connections with the natural world. This book is a record of Savage&#39;s lifelong quest to engage readers in a conversation that enriches our lives and the lives of the animals whose stories she tells.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

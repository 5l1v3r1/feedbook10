  <title>The Adventures of Rocky - Samura Samuel, Samantha Jn. Paul-Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rocky was a wonderful white poodle terrier who we were blessed to have in our lives for thirteen wonderful years. Rocky impacted all our lives, including our daughter, Samura. These stories tell his life in part and how he enriched our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories are set on the beautiful island of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean. As a part of our family, we took Rocky on many outings and adventures with us, and he always made the journey so much more enjoyable and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that we were able to capture Rockys life from his point of view as he was such a happy, upbeat influence in our lives. Long before we published his stories, we relived the wonderful times we spent together; and these stories, in a small way, keep our beloved Rocky in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to share what we hope are inspiring stories with all of our readers. They keep Rocky with us always.&lt;/p&gt;" />

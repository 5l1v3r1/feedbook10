  <title>Principles of Successful Coaching by an Old School Coach—Ron Mayberry - Ron Mayberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first question anyone should have for me is, Why would anyone be interested in an autobiography about my life as a coach? That would be a fair question, since I havent won any national championships nor have I been in demand for speaking engagements. If you compare my coaching record to others, my won-lost record doesnt stand out. With that said, let me explain what I have to offer, and then you decide. This book is not just about my life as a coach, but rather, the lessons I have learned through my coaching career.
Being old-school is about coaching kids and young adults, not a particular sport, gender, age, or level of play. I have coached on every level of play that exists and coached both genders on those levels, along with almost every sport that a school offers." />

  <title>I Can Do That! Woodworking Projects - Updated and Expanded - Editors of Popular Woodworking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Updated and Expanded!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning woodworkers are constantly stymied by the apparent need for thousands of pounds worth of tools to start their hobby. Once they have the tool, they face a learning curve to understand how to use the tool. The next problem is finding wood to build the projects. Not everyone has a lumberyard nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book shows you how to build quality furniture projects that can be completed by any woodworker with a modest (but decent) kit of tools in less than two days of shop time, and using raw materials that are available at any home center. The enclosed tool manual explains all the tools and shows you how to perform the basic operations in a step-by-step format.&lt;/p&gt;" />

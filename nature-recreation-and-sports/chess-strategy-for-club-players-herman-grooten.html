      <meta name="description" content="This new 3rd edition has, besides various corrections and improvements, a new introduction and a brand-new chapter called ‘Total Control’. In this 35-page chapter Grooten adds the final instructive brick to his formidable, yet very accessible, building: inspired by Tigran Petrosian’s playing style he explains amateurs how to exploit small advantages.

----
Every club player knows the problem: the opening has ended, and now what?
First find the right plan, then the good moves will follow!
With this book, International Master Herman Grooten presents to amateur players a complete and structured course on:
how to recognize key characteristics in all types of positions
how to make use of those characteristics to choose the right plan
His teachings are based on the famous &quot;Elements&quot; of Wilhelm Steinitz, but Grooten has significantly expanded and updated the work of the first World Champion. He supplies many modern examples, tested in his own practice as a coach of talented youngsters.
In Chess Strategy for Club Players you will learn the basic elements of positional understanding: 
   -- pawn structure
   -- piece placement
   -- lead in development
   -- open files
   -- weaknesses
   -- space advantage 
   -- king safety
   -- exploiting small advantages.
The author also explains what to do when, in a given position, the basic principles seem to point in different directions. Each chapter of this fundamental primer ends with a set of highly instructive exercises." />

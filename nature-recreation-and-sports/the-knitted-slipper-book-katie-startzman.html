Knitted slippers and house shoes: These are the new frontier for the legions of knitters passionate about sock knitting. And &lt;i&gt;The Knitted Slipper Book &lt;/i&gt;is an everything-you-need-to-know guide to making this exciting variation on the sock. Whatever your preference--moccasins, mukluks, clogs, ballet flats, boots, booties, or Mary Janes--you&#39;ll find all of the instruction you need. This eclectic collection of 30 designs is meant to satisfy the slipper styles of everyone in the family, young and old, male and female. In addition to the knitting instructions, techniques covered include felting; shaping; sizing; attaching soles, linings, and insoles; and finishing with tassels, pom-poms, and other trims. Step-by-step photos assure beautiful, hard-wearing, and well-fitting results.&lt;br&gt;

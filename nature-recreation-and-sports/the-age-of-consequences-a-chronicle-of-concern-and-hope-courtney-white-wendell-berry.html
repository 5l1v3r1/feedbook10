  <title>The Age of Consequences: A Chronicle of Concern and Hope - Courtney White, Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Our planet is approaching a critical environmental juncture. Across the globe we continue to deplete the five pools of carbon &amp;#150; soil, wood, coal, oil, and natural gas &amp;#150; at an unsustainable rate. We&amp;#8217;ve burned up half the planet&amp;#8217;s known reserves of oil &amp;#150; one trillion barrels &amp;#150; in less than a century. When these sources of energy-rich carbon go into severe decline, as they surely will, society will follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Former archeologist and Sierra Club activist Courtney White calls this moment the Age of Consequences&amp;#151;a time when the worrying consequences of our environmental actions&amp;#150; or inaction &amp;#150; have begun to raise unavoidable and difficult questions. How should we respond? What are effective (and realistic) solutions?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;In exploring these questions, White draws on his formidable experience as an environmentalist and activist as well as his experience as a father to two children living through this vital moment in time. As a result, The Age of Consequences is a book of ideas and action, but it is also a chronicle of personal experience. Readers follow White as he travels the country --- from Kansas to Los Angeles, New York City, Italy, France, Yellowstone, and New England.&lt;/div&gt;" />

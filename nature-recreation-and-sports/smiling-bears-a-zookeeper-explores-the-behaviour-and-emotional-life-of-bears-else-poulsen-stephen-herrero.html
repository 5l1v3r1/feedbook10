  <title>Smiling Bears: A Zookeeper Explores the Behaviour and Emotional Life of Bears - Else Poulsen, Stephen Herrero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Few people have known bears as intimately as &lt;B&gt;Else Poulsen&lt;/B&gt; has. This remarkable book reveals the many insights about bears and their emotional lives that she has gained through her years of work with them. Always approaching each bear with the same two questions in mind &amp;#151; &quot;Who are you?&quot; and &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; &amp;#151; Poulsen has shared in the joy of a polar bear discovering soil under her paws for the first time in 20 years and felt the pride of a cub learning to crack nuts with her molars. She has also felt the hateful stare of one bear that she could not befriend, and she has grieved in the abject horror of captivity for a sun bear in Indonesia. Featuring photographs from Poulsen&#39;s personal collection, &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Smiling Bears&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; provides an enlightening and moving portrait of bears in all their richness and complexity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Hooked for Life - Tom Williams, Jena Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide for both novice and expert fishermen. It highlights lakes, rivers, and reservoirs in Colorado and Wyoming, as well as a collection of fishing stories from more than six decades of trout fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focus on the section of the North Platte River in Wyoming called the Miracle Mile, as well as a trifecta of Colorado lakes in North Park called Delaney Buttes. I share tips and directions to twelve other hot spots in Colorado. I also reveal what lures and artificial flies to use and at what times of the year to use them, utilizing the techniques that have provided excellent results for me. I will show you tricks such as how to use the drag on your fishing reel so big fish wont break your line. Also, you will learn the secrets of line watching and the difference between fishing with a fiberglass pole and graphite pole.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Fishing has always been about harmony for me; I find it in the fluidity between wilderness, man, and water. I started fishing with my father when I was six years old. My father was sixty-six then and was still a spectacular fishermanalways respectful of what lies below the surface. Now that Im in my sixties, I can see all the ways Ive become like my father. Taking home your perfect catch takes skill, so let me guide you. I invite you to put your waders on and come test the waters.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Camping with President Roosevelt - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Camping With President Roosevelt&quot; is an account of the author&#39;s trip to Yellowstone Park with former American president Theodore Roosevelt in 1903. A fascinating and insightful story interspersed with examples of beautiful nature writing, this is a volume not to be missed by fans and collectors of Burroughs wonderful writing. Contents include: &quot;A Storm Centre&quot;, &quot;The President&#39;s Interest In Natural History&quot;, &quot;His Love Of Animals&quot;, &quot;Meeting The People&quot;, &quot;A Pretty Incident&quot;, &quot;Ranch Life The Making Of Him&quot;, &quot;Old Neighbors&quot;, &quot;Bad Lands And Bad Men&quot;, &quot;The President&#39;s Cordiality&quot;, etc. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />

      <meta name="description" content="If you are a crafter, teacher or parent interested in recycling Christmas cards, then you will love these pretty eco crafts, ideas and special templates to repurpose your used Holiday cards into charming new crafted items. The full color book with instructions and photographs for the 50 projects, plus the template collection with easy craft templates, are all you need to give used greeting cards a second life. The templates are designed and adapted for greeting card sizes and can be used again and again. Don&#39;t throw away those beautiful cards after the very short holiday period! Create nifty new items for fabulous scrapbooking, pretty packaging, little personal gifts, fun favors, small tokens of appreciation, creative containers, decor, decorations and ornaments! There are bonus projects, printable pattern paper and a second set of blank craft templates too. Make them for yourself, or to sell at craft markets and fundraising events. And use them for school arts and crafts projects too, as many projects are suitable for children. No fancy coordinated craft shop designs or expensive embellishments are needed. Just use what you have on hand. The happy patchwork medley is exactly what makes the projects in Recycling Christmas Cards so charming. It is not just about recycling Christmas cards, but about recycling Christmas fun - all year long! So keep every one of your cards and get started for the next Holiday season, because 40 million recycled cards save 13 600 trees! Reuse, remake, repurpose, reduce, recycle and rethink!" />

  <title>Simple Soldering: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Jewelry Making - Kate Ferrant Richbourg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Metalworking is generally regarded as a skill that takes years of dedication, requires a large studio space, and costs a lot of money. Fortunately, &lt;i&gt;Simple Soldering&lt;/i&gt; proves that does not need to be the case. This handy how-to guide is complete in its exploration of the craft of creating soldered metal jewelry, including tools, techniques, and 20 beautiful projects that beginners and enthusiasts can make at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author and teacher Kate Richbourg demystifies basic soldering for any home crafter, showing how to create sophisticated, polished, and professional-looking jewelry pieces through simple soldering techniques. First, she instructs how to set up a jewelry workspace that fits the confines of your budget and living space. Detailed step-by-step instructions walk you through the basic tools and materials you need, plus how to use them. A sample chapter gives a host of introductory exercises that teach solid skills, allowing you to test these techniques on a small scale. Finally, you&#39;ll discover 20 finished projects that include earrings, pendants, rings, bracelets, and clasps that may also include bead or wire embellishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate also demonstrates how to combine and layer techniques to gorgeous effect. She also examines common mistakes, shows how to correct or adapt them, and gives advice on when it&#39;s time to start over. Most of all, having taught thousands of classes on soldering, Kate has a &quot;you can do it!&quot; attitude that shines through to help even the most reluctant jewelry maker fire up the torch with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate&#39;s expert teaching skills will help projects come alive, right in your own studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Simple Soldering&lt;/i&gt;, the art of metal working one-of-a-kind jewelry is now at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;" />

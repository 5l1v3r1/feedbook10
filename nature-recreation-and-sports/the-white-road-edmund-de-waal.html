      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An intimate narrative history of porcelain, structured around five  journeys through landscapes where porcelain was dreamed about, fired,  refined, collected, and coveted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraordinary new nonfiction, a gripping blend of history and memoir, by  the author of the award-winning and bestselling international  sensation,&lt;i&gt; The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hare with the Amber Eyes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;The White Road&lt;/i&gt;,  bestselling author and artist Edmund de Waal gives us an intimate  narrative history of his lifelong obsession with porcelain, or &quot;white  gold.&quot; A potter who has been working with porcelain for more than forty  years, de Waal describes how he set out on five journeys to places where  porcelain was dreamed about, refined, collected and coveted-and that  would help him understand the clay&#39;s mysterious allure. From his studio  in London, he starts by travelling to three &quot;white hills&quot;-sites in  China, Germany and England that are key to porcelain&#39;s creation. But his  search eventually takes him around the globe and reveals more than a  history of cups and figurines; rather, he is forced to confront some of  the darkest moments of twentieth-century history.&lt;br&gt;     Part memoir, part history, part detective story, &lt;i&gt;The White Road&lt;/i&gt; chronicles a global obsession with alchemy, art, wealth, craft, and purity. In a sweeping yet intimate style that recalls&lt;i&gt; The Hare with the Amber Eyes&lt;/i&gt;, de Waal gives us a singular understanding of &quot;the spectrum of porcelain&quot; and the mapping of desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />

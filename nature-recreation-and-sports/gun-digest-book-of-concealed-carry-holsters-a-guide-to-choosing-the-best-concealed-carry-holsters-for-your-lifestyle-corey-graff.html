  <title>Gun Digest Book of Concealed Carry Holsters: A Guide to Choosing the Best Concealed Carry Holsters for Your Lifestyle - Corey Graff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&#39;ve completed your concealed weapons class and have your permit. Now you&#39;re ready to go to the local gun shop and pick out that one perfect pistol for self-defense. So far, so good. However, if you&#39;re like most folks, you didn&#39;t think much about how you&#39;ll actually carry the thing around. This can lead to an uncomfortable exchange with the bespectacled gun-counter guy. If your experience is anything like mine, he&#39;ll look down his nose at you while a little drop of white spittle forms at the corner of his mouth. You&#39;ll ask which holster he recommends. And he&#39;ll sneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen this scenario play itself out more times than an &lt;i&gt;I Love Lucy&lt;/i&gt; rerun. Holster selection for concealed carry is quite possibly one of the most misunderstood and glossed over areas in the gun world. Like clothing, holsters are very personalized so you&#39;ll eventually wind up like everyone else who carries. First you&#39;ll have a dresser drawer full of them, then one day you&#39;ll wake up to the realization that a storage unit is needed to contain the rest. With the awesome responsibility of carrying a gun for self-defense comes the opportunity to prevail and survive an otherwise lethal confrontation. Yet that responsibility also becomes a life-changing event with the holster. In all its many interesting designs and variations it&#39;s the one thing allowing you to keep your personal safety tool by your side and close at hand at all times, no matter how you dress. I hope this little book serves as a guide to help you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;" />

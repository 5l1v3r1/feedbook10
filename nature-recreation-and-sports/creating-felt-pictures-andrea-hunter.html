  <title>Creating Felt Pictures - Andrea Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Feltmaking is a popular medium for craftsmen, but few have explored its potential as an art form. This new book demonstrates the exciting scope of pictorial feltmaking and explains how to create felt pictures with the depth and atmosphere usually associated with a graphite drawing or a watercolour painting. Written by a leading felt artist, it shows how to work freely with the wool as if it were paint or a piece of charcoal. Covers essential feltmaking skills for the beginner, as well as techniques and inspiration for the more experienced feltmaker, with advice on how drawing and painting skills, such as perspective composition and the use of colour, can be applied to felt pictures. Illustrated with stunning pictures of finished works, as well as practical demonstrations, it also includes a guide to the presentation and framing of work." />

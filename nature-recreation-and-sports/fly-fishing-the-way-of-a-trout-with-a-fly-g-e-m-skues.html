  <title>Fly Fishing: The Way of a Trout With a Fly - G.E.M. Skues</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Attorney G. E. M. Skues drew upon his vast experience as a recreational fisherman to write this masterpiece of the fly fishing genre, in which he established sunken flies as essential tools for the well-equipped angler. Originally published in 1921, this seminal book retains its relevance in a world in which the quiet pleasures of river fishing remain unchanged. Professional, competitive, and amateur fishermen as well as beginners will appreciate its timeless wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;British fly fishing historian Dr. Andrew Herd hailed the author as &quot;without any doubt one of the greatest trout fishermen that ever lived. His achievement was the invention of fly fishing with the nymph, a discovery that put a full stop to half a century of stagnation in wet fly fishing for trout, and formed the bedrock for modern sunk fly fishing.&quot; Paul Schullery, an American fly fishing historian, seconds this view, adding, &quot;[Skues] was also a modest, humorous, and warmly accessible writer whose writings never lost sympathy for his fellow anglers. His self-deprecating and deceptively simple-sounding writings on trout and fly fishing remain among the wisest and most revealing in the sport&#39;s enormous literature.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

  <title>The A Swing - David Leadbetter, Ron Kaspriske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A National Bestseller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Leadbetter is the most recognized golf instructor in the history of the game. His new book, &lt;i&gt;The A Swing&lt;/i&gt;, is his first for a decade and is an evolution of his swing theories that have successfully helped thousands of golfers globally. His tour players, whom he has coached over the years, have amassed 19 major golf championships. David has been prolific during his 30+ year career in producing books, videos, teaching aids that have inspired golfers of every level to reach their potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A Swing - A stands for Alternative - is a simple way to swing the club, which follows biomechanically sound, scientific principles, and only requires minimal practice. The A Swing has been thoroughly tested with a wide range of players, from tour level to beginner, junior to senior, and the results overall have been nothing short of dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A Swing is a way to develop a consistent, repetitive motion which will improve accuracy and distance, and is easy on the body. It will fix many of golf&#39;s common faults, and the book takes you through an easy, step-by-step approach. With over 200 illustrations, easy drills, and the 7-Minute Practice Plan, golfers now have the opportunity to play the way they&#39;ve always dreamed of. Golf is a frustrating game, even for the top players, but the A Swing will make it easier and more fun. It could really change the way the game has been taught, which hasn&#39;t changed for years - it is not an exact method, and has leeway for individualism. &lt;br&gt;David is excited that the A Swing will help golfers the world over enjoy the game more. In essence, the A Swing is a shortcut to great golf. Whatever your level of play is now, whatever your goals, however you&#39;ve been struggling with the game, the A Swing could change your golfing life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

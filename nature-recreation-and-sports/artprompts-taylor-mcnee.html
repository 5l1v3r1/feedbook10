  <title>Artprompts - Taylor McNee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stuck for something to draw? Want to improve your skills on the widest range of subjects you possibly can? Searching for inspiration for that graphic novel you’ve been planning to start work on forever? Then look no further.
Artprompts, derived from the popular website of the same name, is a treasure trove of brilliant ideas for artists to dip in and out of, and the best way ever to overcome creative block. It’s bursting with hundreds of imaginative prompts written especially for anyone who enjoys creating art. Open this book and discover a huge selection of creative and challenging descriptions of exciting characters, monstrous creatures, immersive environments, enticing objects and hypothetical situations – you might find yourself drawing an adorable girl hugging her huge, hairy pet spider, a robot pug, a misty moonlit graveyard or an alien abduction. Combine the prompts in any way you like to create amazing complex scenarios, or hone your artistic skills on single images. Fill a sketchbook with the things you love drawing, or push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new subjects. Have Draw Something-style competitions with your friends and family, and the prompts even work for writers too. And interspersed between the prompts are longer features packed with practical advice to help you become the best artist you can be.
So what are you waiting for? Flip to a prompt, get your sketchbook out and start drawing!" />

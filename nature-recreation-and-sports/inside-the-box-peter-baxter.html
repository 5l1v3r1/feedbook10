  <title>Inside the Box - Peter Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;A celebration of three decades of cricket and a unique insight into the world of radio and broadcasting. Test Match Special is both a sporting and broadcasting institution that has become synonymous with the British summertime. Since its first live broadcast back in 1957 it has proudly lived up to its original slogan &#39;Don&#39;t miss a Ball, we broadcast them all&#39;. During much of this time the man behind the scenes was Peter Baxter and here, in this wonderful memoir, he recalls the best moments and characters from his privileged perspective inside the commentary box.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;Throughout this period, Peter Baxter worked alongside the legendary John Arlott, the inimitable Brian Johnston and the unforgettable Henry Blofield and ushered in new faces, such as Jonathan Agnew, who continue to entertain, inform and charm listeners today.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;This is the personal, touching and at times, hilariously funny, account of the producer&#39;s time &#39;inside the box&#39;.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;THE AUTHOR&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Peter Baxter has spent a lifetime in radio broadcasting, including thirty four years as producer of Test Match Special.

Independent on Sunday&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&#39;From the first page of this delightful memoir we&#39;re transported into a world of chocolate cakes, jolly pranks and &quot;the bowler&#39;s Holding, the batsman&#39;s Willey&quot;. &#39;Bartex&#39;, as he was invariably known, was there for it all, and this affectionate recollection is the next best thing to being in the commentary box... for any lover of the summer game, this humorous and affectionate account is an unmissable read&#39;.

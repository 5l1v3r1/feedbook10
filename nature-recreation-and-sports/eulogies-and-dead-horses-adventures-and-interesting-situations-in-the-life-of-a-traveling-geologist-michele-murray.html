  <title>Eulogies and Dead Horses: Adventures and Interesting Situations in the Life of a Traveling Geologist - Michele Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a geologist, I travel to remote regions of the world. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Eulogies and Dead Horses&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a collection of some of my travel adventures. The stories focus on the beauty that surrounds us during poignant moments when life is in a fragile state. An underlying theme in this book is the presence of Mortality as an almost sentient, omnipotent being. The situations are described with humor and, in some cases, a bit of geological observation as well. Each story is either about people or about animals experiencing some stressful condition and the subsequent resolution of the conflict. These situations demonstrate the likely existence of a larger plan along an obscure path leading through a mire of challenges. That said, these stories are really about life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am reluctant to use the word, &amp;ldquo;mortality&amp;rdquo;, in this&amp;nbsp;introduction&amp;nbsp;because it usually triggers a predictably adverse reaction in most people. A natural response would be to avoid that topic, do not enter here, and close this book. This subject, however, is part of the world. Mortality is simply an ever present condition of living. In this respect, Mortality is an aspect of life. I describe my travels with an appreciation for the austere world that surrounds us, not only for humans but also for animals. I write these narratives from the perspective of an observer, like a witness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a collection of (hopefully) uplifting and, in some cases, humorous stories about drastic situations I&amp;#39;ve been in. I present these stories for the reader who&amp;nbsp;is on their own journey. The title is designed to catch the eye of someone who is in that special moment when they are looking for a new and interesting book to read. I want to offer this interesting collection of introspective narrative essays for this person. My book should be waiting in an airport kiosk. It should be sitting on a rack in the window of a small mountain town bookstore. My book is for people who have lived an interesting life with some loss, some humor, and some firsthand knowledge of what happens when mortality comes calling. There is a rich life to be lived. Fortunately for all of us, there is also beauty in every turn of the planet spinning on Her axis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who read this book will probably be intrigued as to why there are stories written about eulogies in the first place and how can this topic (Mortality) offer enjoyable reading material? The reader might be curious what this book has to do with horses. The person who reads this book is probably an avid reader of literary essays and enjoys a well written humorous story. These readers are interested in contrast: serious-versus-funny; Mortality-versus-life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the author, I expect to share my belief that the presence of death is not a fearful element to be shunned, rather our own existence and the changes that come with Time make life sweeter, more precious. The poet, Wallace Stevens, wrote, &amp;lsquo;Death is the Mother of Beauty&amp;rsquo;... By that, he meant that without Mortality and the natural passing of all things with TIME, we would have no appreciation of the world around us. There would be no art. No music. There would be no reason to love or pine or have desire. Everything would have the same worth. Without death, everything would have the same value day in and day out. There would be nothing grown dear to us. Nothing would be precious. There would be no Beauty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In summary, these stories uphold the positive nature of people.&lt;/p&gt;" />

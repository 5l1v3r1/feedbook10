  <title>How Good Are You at Backgammon? - Nicolaos S. Tzannes, Basil Tzannes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you already play backgammon, don&#39;t you sometimes wonder how good you really are?  Well, this book is your chance to really find out.
&lt;p&gt;The 50 situations presented here, cover most of the aspects of the game, from initial moves to bearing off strategies. Each problem is graded on the basis of 5 points for the optimum play and some partial credit for sub-optimum but adequate ones, if such exist.
&lt;p&gt;If you rack up a score  of 225-250, you rank right up there with the expertsyou should think seriously of competing in Backgammon Tournaments. If you score 200-224, you are not an expert yet, but you are rapidly approaching this point. A score of 135-199 indicates that you are a good, sound player, probably the best in yourneighborhood. If you score less than 135 points, there is no need for despair. Study this book carefully. It can serve as a case studies tool for improving your game. Besides, the problems presented are not only mind-taxing, they are also entertaining. And the justifications for the optimum play are clearly explained, often culminating in various useful rules of thumb (the closer-closest rule, the rule of even, etc.) for difficult, but commonly occurring situations. Good luck!" />

  <title>A View from the Lake - Mike Yurk</title>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;AView From The Lake is much more then just a book of fishing stories. Yes there are plenty of fish stories but it just as much a book about people and places. There are memories of fishing with a grandfather and father, old and new friends and now a grandson. We travel to waters near and far. We venture to Cozumel for bonefish, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Key West&lt;/st1:City&gt; for tarpon, and to &lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:country-region w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for walleyes and northern pike. Closer to home we fish for bass and panfish, on the Mississippi River for walleyes, and an ice fishing trip to Lake Of The Woods. There are memories of an island and the adventure of camping there as a young boy, confidence in a favorite bait, the joys of Christmas vacation and the much anticipated arrival of the greatest fishing catalog of all time. The stories also relate the frustration with lawn work during fishing season, the importance of selecting a good fishing hat, and the beauty and memories associated with an old reel. There is a cabin in &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Minnesota&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; loaded with colorful characters where just being there is more important then catching fish. There is a muskie fishing story from northern &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/st1:State&gt; that actually begins in &lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; and another story of a mysterious trout stream in &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;. There are memories and laughter, lakes and streams and rivers, family and friends, and all the things that make fishing what it is. &lt;/P&gt;

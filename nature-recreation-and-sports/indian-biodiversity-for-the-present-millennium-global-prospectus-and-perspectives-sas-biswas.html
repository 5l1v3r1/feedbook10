The country in the past millennium contributed immensely towards the development of bio-resource and the management of environment for the welfare of the society and posterity. India has leaped high among the developing countries with the richness of resources and their sustainable management to be placed among the developed nations within foreseeable future.

The book on Indian Biodiversity for the Present Millennium: Global Prospects and Perspectives with 11 chapters brings to the reader accounts on the Indian biological diversity, known and under-exploited with potential for the present millennium, forest and medicinal flora, domestic animal and marine biodiversity with threat perceptions, and conservation needs and priorities.

Conventional international norms for threat categories on species and the newer trends on the habitat are specifically dealt along with criteria and indicators. A chapter provides an account on the status of assessment and evaluation of floristic diversity in different countries. The book also contributes on the integrated and people&amp;rsquo;s participatory aspects on the traditional knowledge and grassroot innovations citing examples as case studies from areas of conservation significance. With a view to assessing various adverse impacts on the biodiversity, the treatise deals on different aspects incorporating national and international issues on the subject.

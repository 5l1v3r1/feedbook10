  <title>Bullies: How the Left&#39;s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans by Ben Shapiro | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Bullies: How the Left&amp;#39;s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans by&amp;nbsp;Ben Shapiro&amp;nbsp;| Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Strategies used by the left to bully conservatives are myriad. They cite race issues, raise issues about class differences, and highlight topics about sexism. They use every possible means to demonize the other side to keep them quiet. Then they act as if such threatening actions are justified because they believe that conservatives are the real bullies; they have to learn how to be tolerant. But Shapiro says that hidden behind the left&amp;#39;s impassioned admonitions against bullying lies their true love of vulgar strategies. President Obama pretends he is against bullying, expressing his opposition with all heart and soul, but in reality, he is truly a great encourager of bullying. According to Ben Shapiro, Obama goes down in the history of modern America as one using bullying tactics to silence the left&amp;#39;s critics.&lt;br /&gt;
Bullies is written by Shapiro, author of the bestselling books Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America&amp;#39;s Youth and Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;

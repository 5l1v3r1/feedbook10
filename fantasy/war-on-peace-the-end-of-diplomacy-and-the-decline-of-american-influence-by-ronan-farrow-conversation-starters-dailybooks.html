  <title>War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence??????? by Ronan Farrow | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;War on Peace: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Ronan Farrow&amp;nbsp;| Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The US State Department is going through a crisis. Its career diplomats are being fired one after another and this is transforming the country from a nation of negotiators and peacemakers to one that prioritizes its industrial military complex. Journalist and former diplomat Ronan Farrow writes that the US foreign relations policy has shifted from diplomacy to &amp;quot;shoot first, ask questions later.&amp;quot; This is compromising America&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;br /&gt;
Farrow stresses we can still do something about it, but will it be too late?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
War on Peace is written by Pulitzer Prize winner Farrow who exposed in The New Yorker movie mogul Harvey Weinsten&amp;rsquo;s sexual assault allegations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;

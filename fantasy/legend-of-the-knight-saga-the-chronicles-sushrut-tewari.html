  <title>Legend of the Knight Saga: the Chronicles - Sushrut Tewari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A girl named Nikita is supposedly a queen in the parallel universe of earth on a planet called Galdarth. And when she reaches there, she is encountered by many monsters of the Dark Ages.
 Galdarth is a parallel world, which is ruled by the warriors called the Knights. But they do not have swords or shield for weapons; instead, they have superhuman strength that can crush mountains. Nikita has two knights who will escort her to Kingslograd, the capital of the knights. And throughout the journey, she and her guardian knights have to fight monsters and demons from the Dark Ages who want to kill her.
The monsters in this world are stronger, faster, and over a hundred times deadly than monsters that were in our world." />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Church of Armes of the Light has battled the forces of Darkness for as long as anyone can remember. The great prophecy has foretold that a band of misfits, led by a high priestess will defeat the Dark Lord Darvezian, armed with their wits, the blessing of the Light and an artifact stolen from the merciless Spider Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their journey will be long, hard and fraught with danger.

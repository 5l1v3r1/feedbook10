  <title>The Shattering Sword - Forrest Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A king doomed by Prophecy...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A warrior haunted by his Past...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And a boy who will become a Legend...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Shattering Sword:
Book One of The Red Star Prophecy&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are rumors of a rebellion in Sydia, and a prophecy threatens King Sevaks reign.  In an attempt to stave off the uprising, the king sends his soldiers out into the far reaches of his realm.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;In the small village of Sunflower, Attur spends his afternoons watching the kings Royal Guardsmen.  When war calls the soldiers away, Attur is left to sit on his ridge and dream of adventure.  Mina is his only solace.  She walks with Attur along the river at night, talking of what their future holds.  One night they return to find raiders in Sunflower, and Attur is struck down as he tries to protect Mina.  He wakes to find Mina missing and his parents murdered.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;A legendary warrior, revered by some and feared by all, drifts through Sunflower. Attur, now alone and without direction, joins the warrior on his journey, leaving behind the only life Attur has ever known, determined to find Mina. He soon learns that he is part of a prophecy, one that calls for the death of King Sevak. While his homeland moves closer to the brink of civil war, Attur must accept his destiny, or fight his future.&lt;/P&gt;

  <title>The Other Side of Midnight - The Return - Author Karen Rivello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Book four) The king of the north must defend Waters Edge and has sent out a small group of elves to the world of men to find Legña and make him pay for the treason against his own kin; though they are not the only ones to have breached the pools. As more of the prophecy comes to light there are also more surprises revealed. The elves must align themselves with the humans, knowing it is the only way to win against King Ërrin who now possesses the black stone of Dalbhach. And as is the evil stone&#39;s nature, the human king has also fallen to its call. When the battles converge on both worlds the chosen one is finally revealed, and it&#39;s not what anyone expected. The One with blood still pure is the only one who can wield the blue sword of blood, forged by the blue flame.  How had the Elvin child been hidden for so long? And who are the other elves that have lived among men that now come to their rescue using their Elvin gifts?  Death waits for many...and yet Death itself will fail." />

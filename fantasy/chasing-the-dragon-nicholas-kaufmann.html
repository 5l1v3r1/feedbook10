      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, St. George fought and killed a dragon—or so the legend goes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth is somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George failed in his mission, and the Dragon still walks the Earth, protected by an undead army, hiding in the shadows and slaughtering men, women, and children for its prey. Each of George&#39;s descendants through time has been tasked with killing the Dragon, and each has failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Georgia Quincey is the last of the line—the last, best hope for defeating the Dragon once and for all. But Georgia is also an addict, driven to the warm embrace of the needle by the weight of her responsibility and the loss of everything and everyone she has ever loved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tracking her nemesis to the small town of Buckshot, New Mexico for their final showdown, Georgia is about to discover the truth about the Dragon, a terrible secret that could put all life on Earth in peril.&lt;/p&gt;" />

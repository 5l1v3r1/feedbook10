  <title>Winklatsch - Rhea Sajnani, Debbiejo Miranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a saying, Small minds discuss people. Average minds discuss events. Great minds discuss ideas. Seriously though, why do we write? As one of the students rightly put it, it is an aesthetic experience. At the Reading Club, our members introduced themselves as writers. The discussions really got their interest to pursue writing stories. They have used written symbols to express all kinds of messages: to share stories, imagine the future; and express love, hatred, humour, or melancholy. We are very proud and confident to say that students are always excited and engage in brainstorming discussions with overflowing ideas. Reading Club updates have been a weekly treat for all club members and staff! 
We, as a team, were so enthralled by the stories written by the students that we read it over and over again; each time the stories were as appealing and touching as it was when read for the first time! 
These short stories were shared with classmates, and the group unveiled their amazing potential; experiences and interpretations have influenced other writers as well. Some of the stories were written as class work to reflect their learning and demonstrate their narrative writing skills. 
Kudos to all the young and quick-witted writers! 
Enough to prove that you are all versatile! 
We cant really wait for another book to be published . . ." />

  <title>Portals in Time - John Joseph Teressi, Verlaine K. Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspirational, magical, and mystical as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, intriguing and thought-provoking as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A Wrinkle in Time,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;a spellbinding adventure tale&amp;nbsp;as in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Celestine Prophecy&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Portals in Time:&amp;nbsp; The Quest for Un-Old-Age&amp;rdquo; enhances your intuition, your love of nature, your adventurous spirit, and your sense of humor as you journey to another world and learn about the Seven Harmonies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this gripping, fantasy novel ten time-travelers living in a dystopian world on the verge of obliteration, volunteer for a mission of redemption. The citizens of Grippland are aging at an alarming rate, and the entire population is at risk. Gripp High Command chooses ten volunteers from their prison and forms the Grippland Eye of Time Exploration Team.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The team&amp;#39;s objective is to travel through time and search for the answer to the extension of life and, ultimately, bring back a cure. The Gripps embark on what they believe is a scientific journey, but they land in another dimension, in the mystical land of Acronos. The two Guardians of Acronos meet the travelers and try to guide them. Suspicious and paranoid, the exploration team spurns the help the Guardians offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With unexplained energy waves, frightening magical creatures, and changes in time and space, the Gripps fight and struggle to survive. Despite the team&amp;#39;s antagonism, the guardians stay close, attempting to assist the ignorant intruders through a cosmological maze. With the visitors&amp;#39; lack of respect and courtesy for Acronos, can the guardians keep the Gripp team safe and find a cure?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;Portals in Time&amp;#39; is an exciting fantasy novel with a riveting plot suffused with the mysteries of time and space. It is a brilliant philosophical New Age novel in which the qualities of two centuries-old classics, Lewis Carroll&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Alice In Wonderland&amp;quot; and John Bunyan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Pilgrim&amp;#39;s Progress,&amp;quot; are melded into a dynamic, futuristic tale. Surpassing dystopian and utopian novels, it is an inspiring spiritual journey that delves into metaphysics and the fundamentals of reality.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;--Susan Sewall, Readers Favorite Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are few times in our lives when we can become lost in a fantasy that can affect our lives in such a meaningful and positive way. You will not forget the characters and the wonder of the intelligence of nature in this story of love, patience, understanding, and redemption that will enhance your life and live in your heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The setting is nothing like I have ever read before, but curiously, it does remind me of something I have known and forgotten, of the sense of being connected to something bigger than myself. &amp;#39;Portals in Time: The Quest for Un-Old-Age&amp;#39; wakes readers up and provokes in them a reflection on the possibilities of life.&lt;/em&gt;--Romuald Dzemo, 5-Stars, Readers&amp;#39; Favorite Reviewer&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Healer&#39;s Flame - Nika Kaitlyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With final exams creeping up quickly, Imani Shae and friends find themselves using all their free time to study.
However, at the park in town, on a day that was supposed to be relaxing, Imani stumbled upon the body of a local girldead. That is when things turn from bad to worse. She tries hard to forget what she saw, but she is still haunted by a ghost who died twenty years before, the ghost of Zoey Bishop.
Zoey follows Imani, leaving nothing but cryptic messages and confusion in her wake. Imani is left to decode them before the man who&#39;s killing teenage girls strikes again. The man is still on the hunt and won&#39;t stop until he has gotten what he&#39;s after, but is it too late for Imani when someone really close to her becomes this guy&#39;s next target? Will she be able to stop the killer and save his target before her heart gets broken?" />

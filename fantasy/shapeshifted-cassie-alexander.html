  <title>Shapeshifted - Cassie Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHAPESHIFTED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassie Alexander&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nurse Edie Spence is once again called upon to save a life...and this time, it&#39;s personal. Can her new community of zombies, vampires, and shapeshifters come to her rescue when she needs them most? &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Edie was fired from her paranormal nursing job at County Hospital, her whole world came crashing down. Now she&#39;s is once again shaken to her core. Her mother is deathly ill and there&#39;s only one thing that will save her: vampire blood. But with the paranormal community shunning Edie, where can she obtain it...without losing her own life in the process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAPESHIFTED &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edie hopes to procure it at her new job at the clinic across town, where the forces of evil loom large. Vampire gang wars are rampant. Old underground enemies are rising to the surface. And Edie&#39;s zombie ex-boyfriend has arrived at the scene-but is he the same man he used to be? And what should she make of the enigmatic doctor with whom she shares an unexpected connection? She&#39;ll have to figure it out soon, because all hell is about to break loose-literally-and time is running out...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Shapeshifted &lt;/i&gt;is the third Cassie Alexander novel I&#39;ve read, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Edie Spence, Alexander&#39;s nurse protagonist, has a real talent for getting into trouble and somehow getting out of it, but each time she seems to have sacrificed something, even if it&#39;s only her couch. And she&#39;s so often sleep-deprived, I worry a little about her patients. But Edie is loyal and tough and determined, and these are all characteristics you want in an urban fantasy hero, which she certainly is. In this book, Edie finds her mother has cancer, and Edie wants some vampire blood to cure her. But Edie&#39;s being shunned by the supernatural community. How&#39;s she going to get it? A loose plot point or two get tied up in this book, but other threads are left open. We can all look forward to what happens next.&quot;--New York Times bestselling author Charlaine Harris&lt;/p&gt;" />

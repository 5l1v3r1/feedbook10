  <title>The Devil&#39;s Looking Glass - Mark Chadbourn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Bond adventure in the court of Queen Elizabeth! 1593: The dreaded alchemist, magician, and spy Dr. John Dee is missing. . . . Terror sweeps through the court of Queen Elizabeth, for in Dee&#39;s possession is an obsidian mirror, an object of great power which, legend says, could set the world afire. And so the call goes out to celebrated swordsman, adventurer, and rake Will Swyfte -- find Dee and his looking glass and return them to London before disaster strikes. But when Will discovers the mirror might solve the mystery that has haunted him for years -- the fate of his lost love, Jenny -- the stakes become acutely personal. With London under siege by supernatural powers, time is running out. Will is left with no choice but to pursue the alchemist to the devil-haunted lands of the New World -- in the very shadow of the terrifying fortress home of the Unseelie Court. Surrounded by an army of unearthly fiends, with only his sword and a few brave friends at his back, the realm&#39;s greatest spy must be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice -- or see all he loves destroyed. From the Trade Paperback edition." />

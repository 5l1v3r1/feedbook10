      <meta name="description" content="One gemstone that changed her life.... 
Now it was almost before me. My breath quickened as I struggled to let go of the necklace. I even stood to pull the box with me, but the ribbon of the necklace reddened my wrist like a hot coal and I cried out in pain. Suddenly all I heard was my breathin, out. The figure moved quicker and quicker, closer and closer 
The figure was now above me, drifting over my head, and then it tumbled on me with the force of gravity. 
And then with a whimper, I fell unconscious as darkness surrounded me. 
ARICA MILLER is thrilled to begin her sophomore year at Hill Valley Private Arts Academy. Little does she know that the prestigious school holds more hidden secrets than shed anticipatedespecially with the headmistress. After she accidentally comes into contact with a mysterious gemstone necklace, she receives strange hallucinations that connect to her familys past. Arica soon realizes that this is no regular necklace, but a necklace that contains power beyond her knowledge. And thats not all. Her world unwinds as she is absorbed with knowledge of a world of sorcery. 
All dating up to Halloween night, Arica must face suspicious friends, monstrous creatures, and the truth of her familys connection with sorcery. But worst of all, she must face a powerful enemy keen on only one thing: the gemstones." />

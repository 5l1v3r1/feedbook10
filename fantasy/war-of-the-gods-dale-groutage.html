  <title>War of the Gods - Dale Groutage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire in the skies blaze unchecked as solar systems go up in flames&amp;mdash;is darkness filling the vastness of the universe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the war of the gods reaches its final stage, the outcome hinges on the actions of two Wyoming teens from a rundown coal camp.&amp;nbsp; Thrust into a war between primeval gods, Danny Roberts and Jeannie LoneTree will determine whether light or dark prevails, but are they valued allies or only pawns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two teens have seen wonders since the fateful day in 1958 that plunged them into cosmic conflict. Danny Roberts and Jeannie LoneTree are worlds away from CoalVille, the impoverished Wyoming mining camp where they grew up. Now on a planet circling Kolar, the herculean star at the center of the universe, the two teens will play a vital role in the climactic battle between gods. Now gods in probation, the two are allied with Viracocha and Neferdor, the supreme god and goddess, in their galaxy-burning battle with the dark god Zuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the universe at stake, Viracocha must decipher Zuron&amp;rsquo;s riddle&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site of the black pit defines the color of the scent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;a puzzle that remains unsolved after billions of years. Should the riddle remain unanswered, Zuron will ascend to become the universe&amp;rsquo;s first divine dictator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters, a member of Viracocha&amp;rsquo;s trusted inner circle is a traitor. Danny and Jeannie will need all their new powers&amp;mdash;and their coal town street smarts&amp;mdash;to prevent darkness from reigning triumphant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope seems lost. Zuron is poised to achieve his goal unless two teens from a rough-and-tumble mining community can solve a mystery that has baffled gods since the beginning of time&amp;mdash;a mystery that may have its solution in Danny and Jeannie&amp;rsquo;s own hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captivating conclusion to the Kopaz series, &lt;em&gt;War of the Gods&lt;/em&gt; reveals Danny and Jeannie&amp;rsquo;s ultimate destinies, assuming they survive Zuron&amp;rsquo;s final push for power.&lt;/p&gt;" />

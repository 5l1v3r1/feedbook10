  <title>The Sevenwaters Trilogy - Juliet Marillier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This discounted ebundle of the award-winning Sevenwaters Trilogy includes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daughter of the Forest, Son of the Shadows, Child of the Prophecy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &quot;Juliet Marillier is among the most skilled of fantasy writers&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Sara Douglass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daughter of the Forest &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautifully re-imagined version of the Six Swans myth. Lovely Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. But Sorcha&#39;s joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift--by staying silent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Son of the Shadows &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Sorcha is the courageous young woman who risked all to save her family from a wicked curse and whose love shattered generations of hate and bridged two cultures. It was by her sacrifice that the spell was broken and her brothers were finally brought home to Sevenwaters. But not all her brothers were able to escape the spell that transformed them into swans, and even those who did were more-and less-than they were before the change. It is left to Sorcha&#39;s daughter, Liadan, to fulfill the destiny of the Sevenwaters clan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Child of the Prophecy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magic is fading... and the ways of   Man are driving the Old Ones to the West, beyond the ken of humankind. The   prophecies of long ago have foretold a way to prevent this horror, and it is   the Sevenwaters clan that the spirits of Eire look to for salvation. They are   a family bound into the lifeblood of the land, and their promise to preserve   the magic has been the cause of great joy to them... as well as great sorrow.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other Tor books by Juliet Marillier&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saga of the Light Isles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wolfskin &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Foxmask &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bridei Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dark Mirror &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Blade of Fortriu &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Well of Shades&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

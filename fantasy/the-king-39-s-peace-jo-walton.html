  <title>The King&#39;s Peace - Jo Walton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sulien ap Gwien was seventeen when the Jarnish raiders came. Had she been armed when they found her, she could have taken them all. As it was, it took six of them to subdue her. She will never forgive them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins her story--a story that takes her back to her family, with its ancient ties to the Vincan empire that once ruled in Tir Tanagiri, and forward to Caer Tanaga, where the greatest man of his time, King Urdo, struggles to bind together the squabbling nobles and petty princes into a unified force that will drive out the barbarian invader and restore the King&#39;s Peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ringing with the clash of arms and the songs of its people, rich with high magic and everyday life, The King&#39;s Peace begins an epic of great deeds and down-to-earth people, told in language with the strength and flexibility of sharpened steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Haunter of the Dark - H. P. Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Haunter of the Dark&amp;quot; is a horror short story written by H. P. Lovecraft in November 1935, and published in the December 1936 edition of Weird Tales (Vol. 28, No. 5, p. 538&amp;ndash;53). It was the last-written of the author&amp;#39;s known works, and is part of the Cthulhu Mythos. The epigraph to the story is the second stanza of Lovecraft&amp;#39;s 1917 poem &amp;quot;Nemesis&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;
Lovecraft wrote this tale as a reply to &amp;quot;The Shambler from the Stars&amp;quot; (1935) by Robert Bloch, in which Bloch kills the Lovecraft-inspired character. Lovecraft returned the favor in this tale, killing off Robert Harrison Blake (aka Robert Bloch). Bloch later wrote a third story, &amp;quot;The Shadow from the Steeple&amp;quot; (1950), to create a trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;
Several of the surface details of the plot were taken directly from Hanns Heinz Ewers&amp;#39; &amp;quot;The Spider&amp;quot;, which Lovecraft read in Dashiell Hammett&amp;#39;s anthology Creeps By Night (1931).&lt;br /&gt;
In Blake&amp;#39;s final notes, he refers to &amp;quot;Roderick Usher&amp;quot;, an allusion to Edgar Allan Poe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&amp;quot;, which Lovecraft described in &amp;quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&amp;quot; as featuring &amp;quot;an abnormally linked trinity of entities...a brother, his twin sister, and their incredibly ancient house all sharing a single soul and meeting one common dissolution at the same moment.&amp;quot; An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia suggests that this interpretation is the key to understanding the ending of &amp;quot;The Haunter of the Dark&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;[W]e are to believe that the entity in the church--the Haunter of the Dark, described as an avatar of Nyarlathotep--has possessed Blake&amp;#39;s mind but, at the moment of doing so, is struck by lightning and killed, and Blake dies as well.&amp;quot;" />

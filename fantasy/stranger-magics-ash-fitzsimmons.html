  <title>Stranger Magics - Ash Fitzsimmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one holds a grudge quite like a faerie . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Colin Leffee wants is to be left alone: to run his used bookstore in peace, and to quietly drink himself to sleep every night in an attempt to drown out the memories of eight-hundred-plus years of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when&amp;#160;a sullen teenage changeling&amp;#160;is flung out of Faerie and onto his doorstep, the long-suffering, wayward son of Titania knows his dreams of solitude are dust. Colin&amp;#8212;or Lord Coile&amp;#225;n, as he is known to the Faerie court&amp;#8212;must track down Meggy, the love of his life, and figure out how her child ended up in Titania&amp;#8217;s clutches to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with family, it&amp;#8217;s never simple. He finds Meggy, only to&amp;#160;see her yanked into Faerie&amp;#8212;and the doors between the realms slammed and locked behind her. Now, it&amp;#8217;s not just&amp;#160;her life&amp;#160;at stake . . . but the fate of magic itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always the loner, Colin reluctantly joins forces with an intensely stubborn wizard, a young priest-in-training who fancies himself a knight, and his half brother Robin (the last most definitely not by choice) on a quest to reopen the doors and restore the balance between the realms. And with exiled queen Mab plotting in the shadows to take Titania&amp;#8217;s throne, and the wizards of the governing Arcanum hiding their own agenda, Colin can&amp;#8217;t be sure whom to trust&amp;#8212;or whether he&amp;#8217;ll live long enough to see the mission through.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win by Gene Kim | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;by Gene Kim | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IT manager Bill Palmer is tasked to handle the over-budgeted and way delayed Phoenix Project. His company needs the Project to help revive its failing fortunes. He has to fix the Project in 90 days or risk losing it to an external IT team. Fortunately, Erik an IT and management expert comes to Bill&amp;rsquo;s rescue. As Bill struggles to implement the Theory of Constraints and other new concepts, there seems to be hope on the horizon. Can he revive the Phoenix Project and help save the company? Is Erik&amp;rsquo;s advice truly effective?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Phoenix Project is written by three outstanding IT professionals who have first-hand experience watching companies win over competitors by implementing IT management concepts featured in this novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;

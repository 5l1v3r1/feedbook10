      <meta name="description" content="Everything on earth has its voice. Sure, there are sounds that cannot be heard. He grabbed a stone and held it in the palm of his hand. See, this one seems not to utter a sound. Contrary to the sea, the plants, or the wind (which have their own voice), things and objects are mute. But this does not mean they cannot communicate. Have you ever asked yourself, for example, if by holding this stone in your hand that you would be tempted to lay it down or throw it in the water? How do you know that that action was not asked by the very same stone wanting to change its position? The majority of us do not know how to listen. We think (though allowing with some benevolence some credit to animals) its a given that senses and feelings are exclusively human. But things, and by that we mean all inanimate objects, are considered bereft of any will, although we are all made of the same matter:  that of the stars." />

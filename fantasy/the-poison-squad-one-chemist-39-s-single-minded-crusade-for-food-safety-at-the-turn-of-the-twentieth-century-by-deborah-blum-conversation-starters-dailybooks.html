  <title>The Poison Squad: One Chemist&#39;s Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century by Deborah Blum | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Poison Squad: One Chemist&amp;#39;s Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century by&amp;nbsp;Deborah Blum | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in the late 1800&amp;rsquo;s, food manufacturers were free to chemically manipulate their products because there were no government regulations to check their actions. Labeling and security requirements were non-existent. Thousands of children died by drinking &amp;quot;embalmed milk&amp;quot; in New York City every year. While Europe made efforts to protect their food from being poisoned, Americans had to fight harder to make their government do something about it. At the forefront of this fight was Dr. Harvey Wiley, a Purdue University chemistry professor who ensured that food safety bills were approved and that government intervenes to promote the welfare of its citizens.&lt;br /&gt;
The Poison Squad is written by Deborah Blum, a New York Times bestseller and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Monkey Wars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;bull; Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;bull; Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;

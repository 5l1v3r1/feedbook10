      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zeara, kidnapped from her home as a baby&lt;br /&gt;and raised as a slave girl in the palace of King&lt;br /&gt;Darius, has fallen in love with the Crown&lt;br /&gt;Prince. But the Princes bride has already&lt;br /&gt;been chosen for him. Is his love for Zeara&lt;br /&gt;strong enough that he will renounce his&lt;br /&gt;birthright and give up his throne, or will&lt;br /&gt;Zeara be doomed to a life without love. Th e&lt;br /&gt;Prince advises his father the king that he&lt;br /&gt;will not marry his chosen bride and leaves&lt;br /&gt;the castle to apprentice himself to a Dragon&lt;br /&gt;Trainer. Enlisting the help of the dragons, the&lt;br /&gt;Prince sets out to discover Zearas origins.

  <title>A Cavern of Black Ice - J. V. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HIGH ADVENTURE ON THE SWORD EDGE OF DESTINY&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Cavern of Black Ice &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in J.V. Jones&#39;s Sword of Shadow series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a newborn Ash March was abandoned--left for dead at the foot of a frozen mountain. Found and raised by the Penthero Iss, the mighty Surlord of Spire Vanis, she has always known she is different. Terrible dreams plague her and sometimes in the darkness she hears dread voices from another world. Iss watches her as she grows to womanhood, eager to discover what powers his ward might possess. As his interest quickens, he sends his living blade, Marafice Eye, to guard her night and day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raif Sevrance, a young man of Clan Blackhail, also knows he is different, with uncanny abilities that distance him from the clan. But when he and his brother survive an ambush that plunges the entire Northern Territories into war, he yet seeks justice for his own . . . even if means he must forsake clan and kin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash and Raif must learn to master their powers and accept their joint fate if they are to defeat an ancient prophecy and prevent the release of the pure evil known as the End Lords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

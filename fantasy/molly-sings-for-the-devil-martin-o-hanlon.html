  <title>Molly Sings for the Devil - Martin O’ Hanlon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tragedy struck the McGinley family in the town of Mulldish in the year 1941 when Frank McGinley was killed in a freak accident. His wife, Agnes, was left devastated. With six children, the widow was left with no option. She sent Cissie, the eldest child, to work in Clydebank, Scotland. Twelve-year-old Cissie arrived in Clydebank in March that same year. Clydebank, at the time, had almost been obliterated by bombing. She soon found work. Cissie met and befriended another girl named Annie McCoy, both coincidentally shared the same birthday and age. 
The years pass, and the girls turn eighteen. One night, after a barn dance, Cissie is brutally raped by a jealous Johnny Byrnes. Cissie becomes pregnant. Not wanting to keep the baby, the women persuade her to go to London to have an abortion. Cissie succumbs, and she sets of by train to London. Her intention though is to have the baby and give it up for adoption. 
Molly is born on Christmas Day. After Molly is adopted, she and her new parents immigrate to San Francisco where Molly accidentally signed her soul away to the devil. Will she get it back?" />

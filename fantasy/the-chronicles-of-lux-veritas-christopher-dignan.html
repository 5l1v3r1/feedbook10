His minions are terrorizing the citizensthe first step in Chaoss plan to overthrow the Lord Creator and dominate the universe. Only one obstacle stands in his way: Lux Veritas. The Lord of Darkness has already pledged to go to any length to find her, possess her, and best of all, destroy her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solas Gambit is a high school hockey player who is haunted by vivid nightmares of trouble stalking the universe. Terrorized by mocking voices, anguished screams, and bloody visions, Solas feels helpless as he struggles to understand why he has been singled out by evil forces. But it is only after a shaman gifts Solas with a magnificent sword that comes alive upon his command that the teen and his two best friends, Dorian Bishop and Amy Jolicoeur are sent through a portal to the treacherous land of Purgator to discover the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this epic fantasy tale, a teenager must pair with an unlikely partner to destroy Chaos and end his dreams of conquest, restore peace in Purgator, and somehow find his way back home alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />

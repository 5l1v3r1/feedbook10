  <title>Caligation - Brhi Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkness closed in on him like a pack of hounds. Buildings passed, warehouses, factories; shadows of silent windows disturbed every so often by dim light, taunting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A city of the bizarre and the unfamiliar, inhabited by monstrous beasts and people with unnatural gifts. A city of tall glass spires mingling with old gothic architecture, where wild animals roam alongside the populace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Ripley Mason awakens after the car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University dropout, casual drinker, and newly fledged hitchhiker, Ripley is&amp;nbsp;tired of the daily grind of study, drink, repeat.&amp;nbsp;Only halfway done with a degree he never chose, Ripley heads north to see if life won&amp;rsquo;t throw him something less monotonous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early into his journey, Ripley suffers a brutal car accident and awakens in a rundown hospital. Nervous, he ventures into dark, unfamiliar streets and comes face to face with horrific beasts. Thrown into a world of supernatural fantasy, Ripley fights to discover where he is, how he came to be here and, most importantly, if he can even get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley was still staring at the wallet in his hands. The clinic &amp;ndash; as he had found out the place was &amp;ndash; had graciously returned it to him. The problem was, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t his. There was no identification, no cards, nothing. Just some strange currency he didn&amp;rsquo;t recognise&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All he knows of this place is a single word: C A L I G A T I O N&lt;/p&gt;" />

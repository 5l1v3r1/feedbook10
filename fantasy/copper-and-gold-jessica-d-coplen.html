  <title>Copper and Gold - Jessica D. Coplen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A magic spell has gone awry, an ancient dragon is missing, and shadow demons are hunting the night. It appears a rogue wizard wants to destroy the world - or maybe just Manhattan - and it starts with a city wide black-out that puts twenty-six year old Minni Masterson in the unfortunate position of having caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needing a distraction, Minni aids her coven&amp;#39;s leader in finding the crazy wizard who is running amuck. The trail leads them across Manhattan with destruction following in their wake as they run from unsuspecting police and are attacked by snarling monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discoveries put them face to face with a gold dragon whose father has been taken by the wizard. He offers to help them in their search but for only as long as it serves his own agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all coming on the heels of Minni breaking up with the love of her life because she won&amp;rsquo;t tell him that she&amp;rsquo;s a witch; it&amp;rsquo;s the same secret which threatens to dismantle her friendship with her best friend. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t the only secret Minni so stubbornly keeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before it&amp;rsquo;s all over, Minni will realize she has reached a point in her life where she has to make a decision: fight a gold dragon or deal with her failing relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting a dragon is easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copper &amp;amp; Gold&lt;/em&gt; is a face-paced adventure for readers who love urban fantasy, especially when it&amp;#39;s tilted slightly on its axis. Characters defy expectations, culminating in a twist you&amp;rsquo;ll never see coming.&lt;/p&gt;" />

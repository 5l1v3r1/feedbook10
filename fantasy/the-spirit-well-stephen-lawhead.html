  <title>The Spirit Well - Stephen Lawhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Search for the Map&amp;mdash;and the secret behind its cryptic code&amp;mdash;intensifies in a quest across time, space, and multiple realities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the true treasure isn&amp;rsquo;t the map at all . . . what if the map marks something far greater? Something one world cannot contain? Those who desire to unlock that mystery are in a race to possess the secret&amp;mdash;for good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kit Livingstone is mastering the ability to travel across realities using ley lines and has forged a link from the Bone House, a sacred lodge made of animal bones, to the fabled Spirit Well, a place of profound power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His friend Mina is undercover in a Spanish monastery high in the Pyrenees, learning all she can from a monk named Brother Lazarus. Still determined to find Kit, she is beginning to experience a greater destiny than she can fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Clarke is overseeing an archaeological dig in Arizona when a chance encounter transports her to 1950s Damascus. There, she finds herself unwillingly drawn to the Seekers&amp;mdash;the last living remnants of the Zetetic Society who need her help to track down the missing Cosimo Livingstone and his grandson Kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are darker forces at work in the universe whose agents always seem to be one step ahead of the rest&amp;mdash;and they&amp;rsquo;re all desperate to gain the ultimate prize in this treasure hunt where the stakes increase at every turn. At the heart of the mystery lies the Spirit Well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lawhead&amp;rsquo;s intricately plotted, compelling tale continues to demonstrate his mastery of world building.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

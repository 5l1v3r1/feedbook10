  <title>Mark of the Finder - Frank Caccavo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seth Kish is restless. Bored with life on the farming borderlands of the Elf nation, he dreams of a more exciting life. When a violent raiding party attacks his village, however, its more excitement than the young elf had imagined. He is sent for aid, but when things dont go as planned, he quickly finds himself alone, unprepared, and in grave danger. Before he knows it, he is embroiled in a dangerous conflict between nations; stalked by an ageless, homicidal wizard; and menaced by unimaginable creatures. 
As he fights to survive he uncovers secrets from his familys past, the first of several trials he will endure on the path to becoming a man. He must travel through perilous lands and find a way to outwit beings of powerful magic that threaten everyone he loves. In his quest hell turn to the help of brave new friends and rely on reserves of strength he didnt know he possessed.
Each decision, each interaction, each escape brings him ever closer to the one confrontation he dreads. Along his inexorable but mystical transformation from boy to man, Seth must learn the true value of integrity, the thrill of love, and the honor of sacrifice as he grows toward his destiny." />

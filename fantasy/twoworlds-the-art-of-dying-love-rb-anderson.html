  <title>TwoWorlds  : The Art of Dying/Love - RB Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TwoWorlds: The Art of Dying/Love, is a visionary, metaphysical fiction, described as an action adventure. In a fast-paced inter-dimensional romp, it&amp;rsquo;s light vs. dark in mankind&amp;#39;s struggle against themselves, where the outcome will determine the survival of the human soul. Earth is balanced on the razor edge between darkness and light. Tipping to one side allows mankind the ability to graduate to a higher state of consciousness. Slipping to the other side leads to self-extinction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unknowingly, Steele and Celeste wander into a dimension where our souls go after death. They are suddenly thrust into a world of love and deceit, caught between government and church, afterlife and hell, greed and selflessness, youth and experience, where constant conflict forces decisions that will determine man&amp;#39;s existence. As they learn about their unique ability to cross between dimensions, they meet advanced souls Star and Jaguar, who explain that this plane of existence is mankind&amp;#39;s evolution to a higher universal understanding. And that Secrets to this dimension were given to them in notebooks written by grandmother before passing on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, a technology wizard has invented a means of teleportation that artificially uses this higher dimension as a Jump between locations. U.S. Representative Bodner, a greedy, self indulgent hypocrite enlists another corrupt government official, an FBI agent and a mercenary group to steal the technology to use for his own agenda. Little does he know, or care, that the overuse of this Jump technology will destroy mankind&amp;#39;s ability to evolve. More crucially, souls will be unable to move on when someone dies. When the final climactic battle ends, a corner of the world is transformed, but mankind&amp;#39;s struggle is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

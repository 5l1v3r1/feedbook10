  <title>Skyriders - Vimbai Gore-Strachan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One decision can change the course of your life forever.
When a stranger approaches Kai at his mothers funeral, Kai chooses to return to her old school hidden deep within the skies. It looks like hes agreed to a lot more than hes expected. Not only is it located deep within the sky on a group of floating islands, but once he realized his mother was hiding a lot more from him than hed ever expected he is plunged headfirst into an adventure of a lifetime as he learns how to ride the skies. 
But theres trouble rising - a danger that could destroy his new life as he knows it. The mystery of his mothers past is still unsolved. With only his trusted friends and faithful Talites, they encounter dragon-like creatures, soothsayers and unpredictable wind tunnels in a race against time to stop the Dracaen uprising before it is too late. But there is one final twist - Kai has to slay his own mental dragons, and if he cant face up to himself then what hope does he have to take on anything else?" />

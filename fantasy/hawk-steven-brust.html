  <title>Hawk - Steven Brust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Vlad Taltos came to make his way as a human amidst the impossibly tall, fantastically long-lived natives of the Dragaeran Empire. He joined the Jhereg, the Dragaeran House (of which there are seventeen) that handles the Empire&#39;s vices: gambling, rackets, organized crime. He became a professional assassin. He was good at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that was then, before Vlad and the Jhereg became mortal enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Vlad has run from one end of the Empire to the other, avoiding the Jhereg assassins who pursue him. Now, finally, he&#39;s back in the imperial capital where his family and friends are. He means to stay there this time. Whatever happens. And whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hawk &lt;/i&gt;is the latest in Steven Brust&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Vlad Taltos series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Watch Steven Brust. He&#39;s good. He moves fast. He surprises you. Watching him untangle the diverse threads of intrigue, honor, character and mayhem from amid the gears of a world as intricately constructed as a Swiss watch is a rare pleasure.&quot; --Roger Zelazny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

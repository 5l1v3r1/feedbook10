But what they didn&amp;#8217;t expect was the deadly magic that was also brought to the desert: the white-robed priests with their lethal Diviners, and the evil god, Dal. Cities have burned, armies have been decimated, and entire populaces have been sacrificed in the Sun God&amp;#8217;s name, and it looks as if nothing can prevent the devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still those with hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire, a Woman of the Song, has already brought considerable magic of her own to fight the Children of Dal, and Ramiro, a soldier who has forsaken his vows to Colina Hermosa&amp;#8217;s cavalry in order to stand by her side, has killed and bled for their cause. Separated after the last battle, they move forward with the hope that the saints will hear their prayers, their families will be saved, and that they&amp;#8217;ll see each other once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stirring conclusion to the Birth of Saints series, Ramiro and Claire&amp;#8217;s journey finds completion in a battle between evil and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

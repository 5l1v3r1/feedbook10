      <meta name="description" content="On planet Earth, Granddad Badger, whose real name is Albert, discovers his astrology charts purpose when he discovers the ancient astrology and anthology occult book as an astronomer and scientist after he retires from the chief of police position. His best friend, Archangel Ariel, is on Earth to carry out Gods duties and responsibilities by stopping the bad spirits coming to Earth and taking over the newfound planeta flying planetwhen their other friend, Mr. Coldwater, and his hoard of cats begin to act suspicious. Granddad Albert and Flight Boss Archangel Ariel decide Mr. Coldwater cant be trusted. The bad spirits fail to use Mr. Coldwater and his devoted cats as a body vessel on Earth for long as they fight off the bad spirits with their unconditional love frequencies. Eventually, as the love and vibration frequencies take over the dark spirits and as darkness cannot attack light, the bad spirits had to find another way to possess the planet Earth. They knew the highly intelligent humans, even the cats and animals, proved too hard to possess by the bad spirits. They eventually found their way into planet Earths realm of reality in the form of an objectthe robots frequencies and vibrations that the humans thought they were creating. But it was a way for the robots possessed by bad spirits to take over Earth and create their own power and race. This is where Mr. Coldwater really comes through for his friends, Flight Boss and Granddad Albert. Mr. Coldwater knows whats going on, and hes the only one that knows how to stop his artificial solar system created by himself as a scientist to sustain Earth once the sun died. It was the only way to stop the robots from getting access in and attack the Butterfly Heaven planet where Flight Boss lives, and the possessed robots wanted to expand and take over many other planets and the human beings.

  <title>Sun Child - Kristin Downs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Masada was born into a proud and ever-expanding family of meerkats, the Kivuli clan. His father is a great warrior and his mother a wise story-teller. Masadas brothers and sisters mean the world to him, and they spend hours playing together. Then one day, the sky falls dark in a solar eclipse, and his world changes forever 
When a near-death experience with a marauding jackal nearly takes his life, Masada is thrown into shock, wandering far away from his family. He comes face to face with a deadly snake, but the Isibani meerkat clan saves him. The Isibani take the young pup into their family, caring for Masada as if he were their own. 
But as the weeks pass and Masada becomes more and more like the Isibani, he begins to question his true heritage. Is he a Kivuli or an Isibani meerkat? When the two clans meet and war becomes inevitable, Masada will have to pick sides, fight to the death, and somehow determine the true meaning of family.
Sun Child is a unique coming-of-age adventure about a young meerkat who learns firsthand about family amid the harsh challenges of survival in the Kalahari Desert." />

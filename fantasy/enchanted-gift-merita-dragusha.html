      <meta name="description" content="High above the city of Vollgory sits a castle with high walls and a moat surrounding all sides. Its inhabitants are King Vollg, Queen Solia, and their beautiful daughter Artella. Only the King knows about a hidden room under the castle that holds a secret.
Just before his sudden death, the King escorts Artella to the secret room where she learns of the treasures her father has concealed from the world, including his own wife. Artella is still grief-stricken over her fathers death when she meets Sandri, a castle guard, while on a walk in the yard. Artella and Sandri soon fall in love, but they must hide their relationship from the queen who will surely banish them from seeing each other. When Sandri leaves to serve the remainder of his military service in the Imperial Army, he gives her a gift that unbeknownst to him has the power to completely change Artellas life forever." />

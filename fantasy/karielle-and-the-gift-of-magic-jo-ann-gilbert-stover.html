  <title>Karielle and the Gift of Magic - Jo Ann Gilbert Stover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Karielle, born of humble circumstances, finds early in life that she is different. She can do things others cant. Her family thinks she is only fantasizing. One day, Nathan, Karis half brother, left to care for her and the animals, a task he hates, taunts Kari until she runs away.  Traveling much farther than she ever had before, she trips on the muddy path, spraining an ankle.
A large wolf, Worg, finds her, changing Karielles life forever.  Worg leads Karielle to the hut of the sorceress Gretchen who discovers her gift of magic.  Gretchen, also a healer, begins training Kari.
She loves learning magical skills, and the use of healing herbs. Kari even heals the twisted legs of a young man of the village.
Karielle had never known her real father. His relationship with her mother had been very short.  Rolgrin Hawke, a powerful wizard,  discovers her and comes to the  village where she lives to see if she is his child. 
Therein lies the adventure. Karielle leaves her tiny villagel, travels to Hawkes Reach, and the castle of her newly found father.  Events threaten the land and it is Karielles unique gift of magic that helps save humanity." />

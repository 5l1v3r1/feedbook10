  <title>Blood&#39;s Pride - Evie Manieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Evie Manieri&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Blood&#39;s Pride&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of The Shattered Kingdoms, an engaging, action-packed, and &quot;highly imaginative&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) series of fantasy novels with epic scope and &quot;the perfect mix of romance, family ties, betrayals, and agonizing dilemmas&quot; (&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising from their sea-torn ships like vengeful, pale phantoms, the Norlanders laid waste to the Shadar under cover of darkness. They forced the once-peaceful fisher folk into slavery and forged an alliance with their former trading partners, the desert-dwelling Nomas tribe, cutting off any hope of salvation.&lt;br&gt;Now, two decades after the invasion, a rebellion gathers strength in the dark corridors of the city. A small faction of Shadari have hired the Mongrel, an infamous mercenary, to aid their fledgling uprising--but with her own shadowy ties to the region, she is a frighteningly volatile ally. Has she really come to lead a revolution, or for a more sinister purpose all her own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in a fictional quasi-Medieval Mediterranean region with a strong cast of male and female characters, the series &quot;presents a striking world with civilizations similar to those of the Vikings and the nomadic cultures of the Middle East, and with the Mediterranean sensibilities of the ancient Greeks. Her characters are passionate and memorable, lending a personal touch to a complex tale of clashing cultures and philosophies. Fans of Sharon Shinn, Elspeth Cooper, and Gail Z. Martin should enjoy Manieri&#39;s approach to culture and drama.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Anna and the Otherwhere - Jancis Dienes, Carita Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the far north of Finland, in the time before history, a lonely, young princess longs for a special friend. Playing by herself in the fields behind the castle, Princess Anna suddenly discovers she is in a strange place. The castle is gone and a mysterious child is handing her a lovely flower.Is this the special friend? If not can she find the special friend here? How can she get back home? What lessons must she learn to recognize that special person?
At the same time, on another planet, a child prince, whose father died before he can remember, longs to know more than the stories of his fathers heroism and bravery. He wants to meet his father, but can he? Are such dreams possible on the Somewhere Else Planet? In the Otherwhere? Anywhere?
Can childrens dreams come true? Is making a wish come true complex or simple? What skills must a child acquire to realize a dream?
Anna and the Otherwhere is a unique fantasy from the days before the recorded history of Finland when there were still those who knew how to use innate abilities that have now all but been forgotten. This timeless tale of longing, love and learning will delight all those from nine to ninety." />

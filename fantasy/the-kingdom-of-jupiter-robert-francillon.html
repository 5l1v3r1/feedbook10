  <title>The Kingdom of Jupiter - Robert Francillon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ONCE upon a time, the Sky married the Earth. The Sky&amp;rsquo;s name was C&amp;oelig;lus, and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s was Terra. They had a great many children: one of these, the eldest, was called Titan, and another was called Saturn.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Terra, their mother Earth, was very good and kind; but their father, C&amp;oelig;lus, was very unkind and cruel. He hated his own children, and shut them all up under ground, so that he might get rid of them&amp;mdash;all of them, that is to say, except Saturn, whom he allowed to have his freedom. Saturn grew up; and he thought of nothing but how to set his brothers free. At last one day he went to his mother, and asked her what he could do. Terra had come to hate her husband for his cruelty: so she gave Saturn all the iron she had in her veins&amp;mdash;(you know that iron comes from what are called the Veins of the Earth)&amp;mdash;and he made a great scythe with it. With this scythe he wounded and punished his father so terribly that old C&amp;oelig;lus was never good for anything again&amp;mdash;in fact, we never hear&amp;nbsp;of him any more, except when we turn his name into C&amp;oelig;lum, which is the Latin for &amp;ldquo;the sky,&amp;rdquo; as you know.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Saturn instantly let all his brothers out from their underground prison. They were very grateful to him: and Titan, the eldest, said, &amp;ldquo;You shall be king of us all, and of all the world, if you will only promise me one thing.&amp;rdquo; Saturn promised. &amp;ldquo;It is this,&amp;rdquo; said Titan. &amp;ldquo;You know how our father treated us; and how you treated him. Children are plagues, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to have anything to do with them. Therefore promise me to eat up all your children, if you ever have any, as soon as they are born. They&amp;rsquo;ll be too young to mind and you&amp;rsquo;ll be safe from them. I think so much of this, that if you don&amp;rsquo;t eat them up, every one, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the kingdom away from you. For I&amp;rsquo;m the eldest, and I might keep it if I pleased instead of giving it up to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Saturn had no children then, and he gave the promise. But sometime afterwards he married a goddess named Rhea, who was very good and very beautiful. They, too, had a great many children. But, alas! there was that terrible promise that poor Saturn had made to Titan. Saturn could not break his word, so he ate every child as soon as it was born. Of course Rhea was very unhappy and miserable: it was worse, thought she, than if he had only shut them&amp;nbsp;underground. But there was the promise&amp;mdash;and she did not know what to do..." />

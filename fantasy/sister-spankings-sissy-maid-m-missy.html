  <title>Sister, Spankings, Sissy Maid - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Jill and I were ready to go to college and start a new chapter in our lives, I can tell you this about how Jill and I were raised by our parents.
Understanding that the first job of a parent is to protect their children and teach their children to be responsible adults, what could I say?
Our parents did the best job that a parent could do. Both Jill and I are the most loving and obedient and smart and responsible kids anyone could ever want. We did not drink, gamble, sniff glue, smoke, take dope, or get pregnant. We both got great marks in school.
Over the past five years, of the hairbrush era, Jill was spanked only 6 times. That was not a lot over 5 years. Jill turned out to be such a confident and responsible young lady. I was even impressed with her. Mom taught her well and Jill learned well.
Over that same five years, I was spanked 13 times and I was caned that last time to total 14 times I was punished. However, that was only three times per year. I never was punished when I did not deserve to be punished, so I earned every one of those Spankings.
However, I turned out to be the most respectful and loving and nice son anyone could ask for. Yes, and obedient too. But, never once did I ever think that my Mon was mean to me or too hard on me. My Mom did what she had to do to get me though those growing years that were so much trouble for many of my friends.
Looking back on all the pain and embarrassment and humiliation, I appreciated my Mom for caring enough to be my Mom and not my friend when I needed a Mom. Mom was my friend the rest of the time.
Jill and I get along better than any other siblings we know. Jill and I truly care about one another and understand our perspective roles in our growing up process together.
As a result, Jill got me a room in the same house she and a few friend rented as their own personal college dorm. How great is that going to be, me and five girls in the same house, I can&#39;t wait!!!!!!!!!!" />

Lovecraft wrote: &quot;[Dunsany&#39;s] rich language, his cosmic point of view, his remote dream-worlds, and his exquisite sense of the fantastic, all appeal to me more than anything else in modern literature.&quot; It&#39;s true. Lord Dunsany&#39;s poetic stories are one of the great wonders of the fantasy field. From flying ships to gods and monsters, from Irish myth to the Greek pantheon, this is the ultimate Lord Dunsany collection, with more than 230 classic works in one volume." />

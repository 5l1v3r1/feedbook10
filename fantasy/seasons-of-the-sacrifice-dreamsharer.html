  <title>Seasons Of...The Sacrifice - DreamSharer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the Book:
Though Adrien has been born with status and fame, he does not want any part of it. Warrior-by-birth, he seeks a quiet life not a warriors path, wishing instead to be a writer. 
On the other hand, with legendary abilities when it comes to healing powers and magic, such gifts as Esmes, may become a danger not only to her but to the whole kingdom of Ostwyne, if let untrained. Strong-willed and defiant Esme along with passionate and brave Adrien have to take a journey of self-discovery packed with epic adventures and at times frightening forces.
This is a tale of fearless young warriors who go through breathtaking and exhilarating journeys as they face their ultimate crossroads having to choose their unconventional path, which would definitely change their whole life forever and that of their kingdom. When called upon to fulfil their destinies and take their rightful places in society, Esme and Adrien are drawn into adventures that will touch their hearts and perhaps even scar their souls.
With the kingdoms rules being against them and the narrow-mindedness of the people of Ostwyne, Esme and Adrian join forces to fulfill their eccentric and unique destinies. As dark disturbing secrets start to uncover, Adrien and Esme are forced into desperate battles and undesired circumstances to protect all that they cherish.
With the odds weighing cripplingly against them, the price for their rebelliousness starts to unfold: either they lose themselves and risk their own destruction or they lose their loved ones...What will they each choose to sacrifice?" />

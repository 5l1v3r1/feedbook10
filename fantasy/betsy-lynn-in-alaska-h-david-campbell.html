  <title>Betsy Lynn in Alaska - H. David Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is the story of Betsy Lynn and her best friend Kaya who live in Alaska. Kaya is a full blooded Eskimo girl. Because they live on an island, called Kodiak, they have to take a ferry boat to get to the main land of Alaska. This is always great fun for them. They both live a way from the nearest town of Kodiak, which is also the name of their island. It tells of the girl&#39;s relationships with their parents, friends at school, and their relatives. It&#39;s sad in some parts, and exciting in others. They also have some adventures in the wild country in which they live. Because they live away from the nearest town, they sometimes have to use snowmobiles and their horses to get around. I think you&#39;ll enjoy reading about Betsy Lynn and her friend Kaya&#39;s ventures together. Life is never boring in the beautiful state of Alaska.&lt;/P&gt;" />

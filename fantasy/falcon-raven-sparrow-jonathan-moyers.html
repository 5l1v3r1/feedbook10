  <title>Falcon, Raven, Sparrow - Jonathan Moyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Falcon is becoming a man hardened by the years of being an orphan on the street. His choices these past several months are beginning to catch up to him. He is sure he will be able to talk his way out of them once again. Raven is a dreamer, a girl that longs to be anywhere but home. She spends most of her days thinking about life away from their cottage in the green fields of the valley. Sparrow is a boy raised in wealth that wishes he had friends other than his Gran. All the children do is make fun of him for his small stature and long hair. He desires to be anything but the person he is. The Valley has been peaceful for a thousand years, but at great cost. Evil stirs below the surface of the politics and happenings, a course set in motion long ago, longer than Falcon, Raven, or Sparrow could have known. They will face themselves, each other, and death itself to protect the things they love and hate. But at what cost?" />

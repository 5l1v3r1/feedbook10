    This is a fantasy/sci-fi adventure that takes place in the midtwenty-fourth century. The story is centered around a teenage girl of Indonesian descent
    named Anika Camroon, who was orphaned at the age of five and who finds out that she has been adopted into a family of magical creatures. Anika grows up on
    the planet Gandara with her adopted father, Potter, who is actually half-troll and halfforest gnome. She is chosen by the alien sylph Queen to join the
    sylph army and help diminish the stronghold the evil drageren have over mortal souls. The drageren were once sylph themselves but have now become hideous
    creatures bent on stopping the mortal realm from achieving communion with the Corin, a privilege once destined for them alone. The drageren travel
    throughout different worlds attempting to infiltrate each species and destroy its chance of achieving communion with the Corin. The hatred the drageren
    have for the Queen and the Corin ignites their lust for mortal souls, the protection of whom the Queen has entrusted to Her army of Knights. Anika joins
    the rank of the Queens Knights, and with the help of Logan Anderson, an Aquarian from Earth, and Drew Clarke, a Gandaran Air Force pilot, Anika has many
    adventures that lead her to other galaxies, but eventually, she always returns home to her adopted father, Potter. Anika spends the rest of her life in the

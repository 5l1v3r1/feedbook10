  <title>Sonoma Quadrant - C.H. Foertmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Near Fordyce, New Mexico in the midst of the Sonoma Desert lies the Sonoma Quadrant. No airplanes have ever disappeared in the Quadrant. Obviously, no ships have ever disappeared there either.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;What has disappeared there? PeopleFor hundreds of years people have gone into the Sonoma and have never returned. Public records in nearby Fordyce indicate seventy-two such disappearances dating back as far as 1874 when records were first kept. Records from the abandoned Mexican village of Sonoma Rojo indicate disappearances dating back to 1644. Indian legends dating back to the Anasasi hint at the mysterious area as a place one does not return from.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But one man did emerge. In 1880, a prospector known only as Griswald was allowed to leave. Now, in 2003, Griswald is returning to the Quadrant and taking with him Tom and John Fischer. How could he still be alive? Why, after one hundred and twenty-three years would Griswald return?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In this sequel to C.H. Foertmeyers &lt;i&gt;The Cats Lair&lt;/i&gt; you will once again travel with the Guardians and discover things that may change forever the way in which you view the struggle between the powers of good and evil. You really havent a clue&lt;/p&gt;" />

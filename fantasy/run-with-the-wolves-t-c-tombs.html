  <title>Run with the Wolves - T c Tombs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During the turbulent fifteenth century, fearsome creatures roam the night and terrorize the countryside. Willie, a young Medinian serf, was bitten during an attack on the farm livestock and now suffers from the same full moon affliction as his mentor, Woodrow, and the rest of the Pack. As Willie moves from one moon cycle to the next, he soon realizes that his fate has been changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he attempts to adjust to his new life and uncertain future, Lord Victor, the king of Varakov, is determined to provoke a war that threatens to destroy all who reside in Sanctuary. Caught up in the midst of this dire situation, Woodrow must decide whether to honor his sacred pledge to his dark master or stand in opposition and risk his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Hunters Moon arrives and the goddess Diana rises in the sky to lay claim to her children, the Pack leader embarks on a dangerous trek to seek out the cavern of the Oracle. Now, only time will tell if the reclusive old sage holds the answers he desperately seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of the full moon. This one is for all of the werewolf lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Book Reviewers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-written and addictive first novel.&lt;/p.

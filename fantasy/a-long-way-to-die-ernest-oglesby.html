  <title>A Long Way to Die - Ernest Oglesby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;With the truce between the Roman Catholic Church and Gabriels family still in place, Gabriel, Laura, and Belle begin to settle into a normal routine. As Belle resumes her modeling career in Rome and Gabriel and Laura live a quiet life in Argentina, a terrorist call begins to unleash its fury onto the world.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A man with the code name Torquemada has been chosen by Al Queda to spearhead a Jihad against the worlds religious, starting with the Holy Roman Catholic Church in Italy. To the Italian security forces, he is anonymous. To Gabriel, he is trouble. When Gabriel is asked to aid the Sword of Solomon in their battle against the terrorist, he is reluctant to help, he has such both a previous history with the terrorist organization ETS and a similar connection with the Catholic Church. Gabriel has no choice but to help take down the cell before more innocent people die, including his daughter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this fantasy thriller, Gabriel, Laura, and Belle are once again propelled into a life and death battle with evil forces who desire nothing more than to see them destroyed. Now only time will tell if their wish will be granted.&lt;/P&gt;" />

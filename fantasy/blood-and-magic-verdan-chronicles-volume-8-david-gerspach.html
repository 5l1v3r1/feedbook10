      <meta name="description" content="Blood and Magic continues the adventures of Celecia and Dakoran in Verdan&#39;s future. While they attempt to find a way back home, they must also deal with the growing threat from North Maroa and resurgence of an ancient enemy, the vampires. The demonic creatures from Jamut&#39;s realm are once again led by the demon who inhabits the body of Celecia&#39;s former sister, Tathiel. And with the growing presence of magic, these mystically fueled creatures will no longer be contained.   In North Maroa, Wendy leads a band of rebels seeking to depose the president who came from Verdan&#39;s past.   Mriccon travels to Parthea to learn the state of the religion he founded.   And while the world reels from unfolding events, a forced reunion causes enemies to reveal past secrets and work together if they are to survive. Their efforts result in a better understanding of each other and of themselves. All of this leads to a cataclysmic confrontation and sets the stage for The Fifth Age." />

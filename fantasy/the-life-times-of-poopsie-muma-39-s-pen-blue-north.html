  <title>The Life &amp; Times of Poopsie, Muma&#39;s Pen - Blue North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Life &amp; Times of Poopsie, Muma&#39;s Pen is an animation - come to life, of a dear sweet woman whose pen comes alive! It is a comedy of lovable motherly pangs towards her insincere but adorable little pen.
The muma loves to write. Her pen, who has come alive, is sickeninly (but most lovingly) proud of his most special (7 year old) self. He is a boy...and he&#39;d never know he was made of the pen-family, and so... All the precious antics that go along with a 7 y.o. and a muma (who has held him her whole life), who writes - to fill in the gaps of her unmarried, overweight, lonesome (paranoid) life - come into play... as a comedy, unfortunately. You&#39;d never know it; for she lies and lies and life (to herself) about thus; sometimes sounding like Marilyn Monroe - who hasn&#39;t dated for years.
You can imagine the imaginings of the episodes she gets into, or gets Poopsie out of. Either Poopsie and his little hearts view of the world, his feelings, or a trauma/tragedy/event that has happened to him. Otherwise, the tale could be about the muma - of reputable, self-indulgent flame for her own very motherly feelings or reactions to the world or her Poopsie, and/or anything that involves itself with our business.
Oh yes, he is 7 y.o., but at times thinks himself an elderly, worldly frenchman (a roughly 49 y.o. Maurice Chevalier, is what it is).
The Life &amp; Times of Poopsie, Muma&#39;s Pen is written in either one-page little episodes or tritely brilliant lengthier tales. All, most sweet and enjoyable. All for adults - of all ages.
The continuing tales of Poopsie and his friends will be forthcoming in extended books. It is guaranteed in the last tale of this first book, called &#39;A Poopsie Tale&#39;. The muma performs a transformation. Its all very halloweeny, but don&#39;t be distressed  the muma can never change; for, she is me! [A-hem...] The title!
Side Note (and most needed fictional input): I have nothing in common with dis muma, except that I am unmarried." />

  <title>The Plain Man - Steve Englehart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magick and reality collide in a new, fast-paced Max August thriller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max August is not invulnerable, but he never ages--a gift he earned while studying under the legendary alchemist Cornelius Agrippa. August, now an alchemist himself, is using his magickal abilities to fight the right-wing conspiracy known as the FRC, which seeks to control all aspects of society. At the top of the FRC is a nine-member cabal, each member of which is a powerful force in one area of society, such as media, politics, finance...and wizardry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Max learns that two members of the cabal are en route to Wickr, a Burning Man-like festival held in the American Southwest, he stages a plan to gather information from them and, he hopes turn one member against the others. Max has been careful not to leave a trail, but the cabal sees all, and an &quot;accident&quot; at a nuclear waste facility just 100 miles from the festival would send a clear message to those who oppose the FRC. Max may be timeless, but he is running out of time to stop the FRC and save millions of lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

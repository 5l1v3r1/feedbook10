  <title>The Fairy Forest - Barbara Costanza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is based on a true story within a privately owned forest preserved for the minds of creative people. Mossy trails with interesting twists and turns are lined with homemade fairy houses. After our familys loss of a child, we decided to gather a community of friends to use our land as a magical place to go for peace and to connect back to nature. We asked friends and family to write their own fairy character and some are used in the book.
The main character in the book has suffered the loss of a sibling. She is asked to watch the family cat for five days, which she is not very interested in doing. She has many complaints about this chore being she is a doctor, mother, and wife and not in a good frame of mind, she feels overwhelmed with life.
 	The first day, it started to happen, while going to the house to check on the cat she ventures into the woods only to discover a whole new dimension of life. While she is walking on the path looking for the cat she trips over a tree root and falls. She is not sure if she has injured her head or if what she sees next is real. She meets a figment of her imagination named Rosy.  While laying on the ground the character sketches what she sees. Rosy is an old spirit who guides her each day through the woods.  The next morning the fairy spirit is revealed on the sketchpad, which begins the true-life journey.  Each day for five consecutive days, she returns to feed the cat and ventures back into the woods. She meets different fairies and she has unordinary experiences. Once she enters through the gate she is transformed physically into the fairy realm. She gets introduces to many of the fairy characters and is impressed with their diversity as they show their own personality and special gifts.  On the last day, through the evidence of her sketched drawings, she is becomes aware that this was not just her mind playing tricks on her. For her it is a personal journey discovering how to enjoy the simple things in life just as she did when she was a child. She is shown that her sibling is still with her and lives on it the afterlife filling the emptiness in her heart.  
The photography in the book will make readers feel like they are taking the adventure with her. We know that nature has its own way of healing the human spirit in ways beyond our comprehension. This story is a light read and can only make you feel that love is all around us even when we feel alone. 
The real character and illustrator goes through the grieving process and slowly begins to heal using her creative mind.  She went back to college and received awards for her drawings. It has enlightened and changed her life. We hope that the readers will find their own personal creative self while taking a walk through these pages." />

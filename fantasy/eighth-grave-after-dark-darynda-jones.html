  <title>Eighth Grave After Dark - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There&#39;s holy hell to pay for Charley Davidson in &lt;i&gt;Eighth Grave After Dark&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller from Darynda Jones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With twelve hellhounds after her, pregnant Charley Davidson takes refuge at the only place she thinks they can&#39;t get to her: the grounds of an abandoned convent. But after months of being cooped up there,  Charley is ready to pop. Both metaphorically and literally since she is now roughly the size of a beached whale. Fortunately, a new case has captured her attention, one that involves a murder on the very grounds the team has taken shelter upon. A decades-old murder of the newly-vowed nun she keeps seeing in the shadows is almost enough to pull her out of her doldrums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley&#39;s been forbidden to step foot off the sacred grounds. While the angry hellhounds can&#39;t traverse the consecrated soil, they can lurk just beyond its borders. They have the entire team on edge, especially Reyes. And if Charley didn&#39;t know better, she would swear Reyes is getting sick. He grows hotter with every moment that passes, his heat scorching across her skin every time he&#39;s near, but naturally he swears he&#39;s fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the team searches for clues on the Twelve, Charley just wants answers and is powerless to get them. But the mass of friends they&#39;ve accrued helps. They convince her even more that everyone in her recent life has somehow been drawn to her, as though they were a part of a bigger picture all along. But the good feelings don&#39;t last for long because Charley is about to get the surprise of her crazy, mixed-up, supernatural life....&lt;/p&gt;" />

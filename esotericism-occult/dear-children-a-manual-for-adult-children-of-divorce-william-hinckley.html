  <title>&quot;Dear Children&quot;, a Manual for Adult Children of Divorce - William Hinckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for Adult Children of Divorce  or anyone who may be in a relationship with someone who has experienced divorce. &quot;Dear Children&quot;, will help you understand the roots of the dysfunctions developed as a child of divorce and offer a proven means for overcoming them. This journey will enable you to break through the developmental issues that can often bind you in your daily life  influencing everything from minor choices to major, life-changing decisions. This investment of time will help you discover who you really are, where you really came from and the power that this source offers you on a daily basis. You will come to understand the strength of your essence and discover the knowledge and skills to honestly and continuously reflect on your personal situations (or those of a loved one) in order to embrace a truly uplifting and empowered life. Through honest introspection, greater knowledge and embracing daily habits you will be able to live a fulfilling, uplifting and joy-filled life.
We will explore the dysfunctions associated with divorce including separation, people-pleasing, abandonment, guilt and fear of conflict. We will examine some of the personifications and manifestations that adult children of divorce may use to mask their pain  in order that you may better understand if this is occurring in your own life or the life of someone you love. More importantly, we will discuss how you can overcome such dysfunctions and manifestations  and what you can do to prevent these destructive habits from continuing. We will further explore how daily habits can empower you towards success and fulfillment. You will come to understand how to embrace joy, how to make good decisions and how to ensure that the cycle of divorce, and its ill effects may be halted. You will learn how to be happy and empowered  every day!" />

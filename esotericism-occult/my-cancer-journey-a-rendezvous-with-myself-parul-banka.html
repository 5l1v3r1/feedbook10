  <title>My Cancer Journey – a Rendezvous with Myself - Parul Banka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My book &lt;i&gt;My Cancer Journey  A rendezvous with myself&lt;/i&gt; is a candid narration of my encounter with breast cancer. It is the story of an ordinary woman who was put in extraordinary circumstances, and who undertook her cancer journey with the utmost courage. &lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir is not just about describing a difficult medical condition. It is about going through the experience, and emerging from it wiser and stronger. It is about using cancer as a life changing experience, despite all the trauma and the loss  and the change neednt be for the worse. It is about understanding the choice that a human being has  the choice to accept what cannot be changed, and to use one of the toughest fights of life to evolve into a better person, irrespective of the prognosis. Pick up a copy to embark on a rendezvous with your inner self!&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A factual, informative and profound book, truly from the heart. I highly recommend this book, and it offers some important insights from holistic therapy.&lt;p&gt;

  <title>Swimming in Circles Is Better Than Drowning - Leanne Garrett Flanagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Swiimming in Circles Is Better Than Drowning chronicles the story of a less-than graceful, tragicomic transformation from privileged daughter of her &quot;perfect&quot; 1950&#39;s family to middle-aged wife, mother and daughter.
      This book will engage you from the beginning by revealing rmemories.  from childhood and adolescence,wriitten about in &quot;Fitting In,&quot; &quot;My 15 Minutes of Fame&quot; and &quot;The Train Station.&quot;  The author&#39;s marriage and family life is portrayed in &quot;None Other Than Motherhood&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of the Waiting Room&quot;.
     Midlife substance abuse interrupts the good life where the works turn intense and deeply emotional with &quot;Circling the Drain&quot; and &quot;To and Fro.&quot;  Our heroine begins her recomvery from her desolation with a lot of help, hence the poem, &quot;Celebration.&quot;  More of her humerous side is shown in a witty, tongue-in-cheek observation, &quot;The Virgin Commute.&quot;  Regained spirit and hope are evident in final chapters with &quot;Increasing Fits of Happiness&quot; and her ending, &quot;My Obit.&quot;
       This book can offer solace and hope to some who have suffered or are still suffering from alcohol abuse and/or depression. Anyone who has lived with or has known the pain of watching one who lives an abusive lifestyle will relate to this story. They may also gain a better understanding of how we think and survive by planning every move around our addictions.
    In an imaginative memoir style, the mingling of light and serious essays along with a few poems provokes reflections, a few chuckles and maybe a few fond memories for the reader.
     Lee says, &quot; I have dogpaddled through the deep end of life, but now I know it doesn&#39;t matter if don&#39;t  get points for style. I am happy I am able to keep finally swim to shore and remain on solid ground--most of the time!&quot;" />

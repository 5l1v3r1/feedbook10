  <title>Birth, Death and the Afterlife - Madonna J. Kettler PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world filled with food, booze and a gazillion other distractions, Birth, Death and the Afterlife offers innovative approaches to living fully, peacefully, and loving unconditionally.
A wonderful book. Very comfortable and very deep. Its like having both your best friend and spiritual teacher sitting next to you on your couch, teaching you, reminding you of who you are and whats important in your life.
Robert Peterson, author of Out of Body Experiences
In my work both as a lawyer and a psychic, I have met with hundreds of people struggling with fears, addictions, and blocks, many of which stem from past life issues. Birth, Death and the Afterlife brings marvelous relief by teaching you how to remember your divine self and reclaim your personal power.
Kathryn Harwig, author of The Return of Intuition and seven other books
No matter where you are on your spiritual path, Birth, Death and the Afterlife meets you there and guides you to your next level of self-discovery. Designed for spiritual seekers of all types, it includes case studies and stories that awaken, enlighten and empower.
Nancy Fischer, author of Choices: Escaping the Illusion of Being a Victim
Dr. Kettler escorts you on the journeys of others, using fine-tuned regressive hypnotherapy skills to discover unremembered memory segments in the souls life-cycle that validate your human and spiritual existence. It illuminates hypnotherapists, potential clients, and the general readership in multiple areas of personal growth and transformation.

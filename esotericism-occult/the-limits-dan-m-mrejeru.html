  <title>The Limits - Dan M. Mrejeru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;The Limits &lt;/I&gt;is my first work in English, with English as my second language. It dates back to1994. It has been my first intellectual attempt since I came to the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:country-region w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;U.S.&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; in 1985. My first try in 1994 was a very hard work which, at that time, went nowhere, because of my language limitations, and because my general knowledge was not to the level of this task. However, at the beginning of 1995, I abandoned this writing as a literary work and&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;turned toward upgrading my scientific knowledge through personal study. In 2000, I made a new attempt, and the result was the original draft of the &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Seven Essays on Creation&lt;/I&gt;, which is my second book with AuthorHouse. In 2001, I abandoned this new work and continued with my science study. A special conjecture in 2003 made me publish the first book with AuthorHouse, which was &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Multiple Harmonics Create the Patterns of Real World from Chaos&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;After publishing this at the beginning of 2004, when I threw away mountains of old papers, I discovered the Seven Essays, and I decided to give to it another chance. In three months, it became another book, which was the &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Seven Essays on Creation&lt;/I&gt;, which was also published in 2004. In September 2005, while searching among some old papers, I discovered the original draft of &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;The Limits&lt;/I&gt;, and I decided to do something about it. I have to say that &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;The Limits&lt;/I&gt; has been on my mind for more than ten years, and I adored this old work. However, I was afraid that I would never be again be capable of writing the way I did in 1994. In the meantime, I was happy that, at the present, I had the answer to the philosophy that I wondered about eleven years ago. It was the nonlinear thinking that changed me a lot over the years. It was real, and I decided to rewrite &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;The Limits&lt;/I&gt;. I tried to preserve as much as possible from the old draft, and I inserted in each chapter some nonlinear wisdom.&lt;/P&gt;" />

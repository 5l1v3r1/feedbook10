  <title>I Am: This One Life - Carlos Alvarez Cotera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Am: This One Life is about how I, the author, was able to overcome a lifelong battle with mental illness that almost took me to the brink of suicide. Fifty years on a road filled with obstaclesobstacles created by a suffering mind that struggled to stay clear of the abyssand the spiritual journey that eventually saved me.
I shared my own experience of triumph over adversity so that the reader may benefit as I did from the knowledge and wisdom I have received.
This book is written in a simplistic manner as to better convey the message it is intended to send. Through personal experiences and examples, my quest is to engage the reader in a self-dialogue.
Give me a chance to show you how your life can change as mine has. You do not have to believe you are in need of change to benefit; this wisdom can change a life thats good, bad, great, or magnificent into more. For those who enjoy life as it is, it will get better, and for those whose life is a Calvary, a radical change to a blissful existence is within reach." />

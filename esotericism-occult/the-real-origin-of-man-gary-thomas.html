  <title>The Real Origin of Man - Gary Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Real Origin of Man shows how all &quot;legends and myths&quot; tell the real story of Mans beginnings.  The Bible, Sumerian Texts, Hopi Indians and Edgar Cayce all claim we were formed by a spirit race. The Bible codes much of the information but the author shows the proper translation of Biblical stories and how they verify Mans beginnings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book also covers Atlantis and their advanced culture ( much like ours today ) and how the survivors of the Great (Noahs) Flood escaped to Egypt and created the Pyramids and an advanced society. From there it covers the hidden life of Jesus ( ages 12 to 30 ) and names his teachers and subjects studied.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book explores the Freemasons and their &quot;secret society&quot; that still rules the world today!! Finally, the book explains how World War Two was actually a battle between Atlantean bloodlines. Packed with information, you will be able to delve into all of these areas and much more that is covered in this book. Forget what you learned in school, you are about to read the Real Origin of Man and who really runs the world today.&lt;/P&gt;" />

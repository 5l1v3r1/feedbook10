  <title>Gifts of Guidance - Liz Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Messengers from Spirit come in many forms. In the thirty years that Liz Winter has worked as a spiritual medium, she has seen and communicated with many. In Gifts of Guidance, Liz shares fifty inspiring messages co-created with Spirit intended to help anyone find wisdom, insight, comfort, and the peace that already lies within each of us.
Along with the profound messages, Liz includes visions, lessons, power choices, affirmations, momentary meditations, and personal insights peppered with opinions by her own spirit guide, White Owl. Through a step-by-step process, Liz encourages others to set clear intentions, ask for help with a specific issue, randomly open the book to read whatever message appears, and then intuitively trust how to apply the message to each unique situation found within an earthly journey. 
Gifts of Guidance shares fifty readings from the other side that will encourage others to reach out for support, find comfort and wisdom in the messages, and know that none of us walk alone in life.
  Liz has created a rich tapestry of support for us with her angel guidance, combined with evocative imagery. But more than that, she offers us herself

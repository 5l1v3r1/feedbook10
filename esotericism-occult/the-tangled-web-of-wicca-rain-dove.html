  <title>The Tangled Web of Wicca - Rain Dove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a Traditionalist. A Traditional Wiccan High Priestess Witch.
I am not a person with an Ivy League education. Nor am I a scholar with 6 or 7 degrees!
I do not speak any language other than English, a few choice Spanish words and some pig latin. I don&#39;t use big fancy words where you have to have a dictionary to read the book and I don&#39;t use long, complicated sentences that you have to read 16 times to understand what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m not a professional writer and even if I were, I felt this book needed to be written where anyone could read it without any difficulty no matter the level of reading one does or how long they&#39;ve been on the path of Wicca.
Most people will agree there have been many books written on the subject of Wicca. 
So many of them it can become confusing and frustrating for the Novice because most books are simply bits and pieces of Wicca thrown together coupled with a person&#39;s personal opinion and experience. There are many important details left out. 
Details that are inclusive in most Traditional Wiccan training. 
Keep in mind there&#39;s only one way to receive full training and it does not come from a book or from the internet. 
This book is different than your average &quot;how to&quot; book on Wicca. 
There are no spells. It is not about magic. 
There are no instructions on how to cast a Circle or how to call the quarters. 
There&#39;s plenty of books out there on all of those subjects. 
If that is the kind of book you were expecting, I am happy to inform you that it is not.
This is a book that explains a (seemingly) fast disappearing perspective regarding important protocol and important elements that are missing in today&#39;s practices within the religion of Wicca in our American Wiccan communities today. 
A perspective (believed by many) that should return. 
The book also points out some of our problems and issues in the Wiccan community that are going on here today in the United States. Problems and issues that have arose since the occurrence of Wicca&#39;s massive growth spurt and the booming book and internet industry that surrounds it! 
This book is written based on my training, experiences, knowledge and information that I have personally gained over the years from walking and living the life of a Wiccan Witch. 
There is information contained within this book that you normally would not hear or know about Wicca unless you had (or have) a teacher. Teacher meaning a &quot;Traditional Wiccan High Priestess or Priest Witch&quot; to help you along, to guide, direct and train you. 
The sole purpose of this book is to give you some of that information that you would not receive without training, without an experienced High Priestess or Priest to give it to you.
Much of it is information that you will not find in books and is vital to Traditional Wiccan practice. Some which is basic Wiccan protocol that has been passed down orally and/or verbally through the generations, some since the beginning of Wicca and its oral Traditions in the United States. Oral and verbal protocol that was (and still is) being given to Novices in their beginner level training in some of the working Traditional Covensteads.
My hope is that it will provide the reader/s with a fresh (yet certainly not new) look at Wicca and hopefully help guide them in the direction that&#39;s most beneficial for them.
If you find it to be controversial for, remember this is a perspective coming from a Traditional Wiccan Witch who has been formally trained in a Tradition of Wicca in a Traditional Wiccan Coven.
Either way, I hope anyone who reads it will get something from it even if its just a small something and that it will help in some way as you step onto the path of Wicca or onto the next crossroads of your journey in Wicca. 
Before you begin to read this book, please understand that I am not staking any claims that I am the &quot;Wiccan Guru&quot; or the &quot;Grand Poohbah of Wicca&quot;!
I have never claimed such nor will I ever claim such ! 
So please do not take my words out of context or twist them in any way!
I ask that you understand and know that my words are in no way conveying that a person is not legitimately Wiccan or not legitimately practicing Wicca if they don&#39;t do things the way I explain in this book or if they do not practice the way I do! 
It is not a book that says &quot;do it this way and no other or that my way is the only way or the best way.&quot; Not at all.
The book was written for the reader/s to understand Wicca from a Traditional perspective and to come to their own conclusions about what to do (if anything) after reading it. Again, this is a book written from my own training and experiences and from the knowledge I have gathered over the years of walking this path.
If you have questions about something that is stated in the book, please refer to the Facebook page that is set up for discussion of the book.
I am sure some folks will go on with their usual way of doing things, regardless of what I have to say. And I wouldn&#39;t expect anything more or anything less. 
I do not wish to complicate things for anyone. 
I am in hopes it will answer some questions or rid the reader of any preconceived ideas or confusion she/he might have, maybe even eliminate some of the incorrect information you have come across during your seeking and/or walk in the path of Wicca thus far. 
If nothing else, maybe it will provoke thought on some new (yet not new) ideas.
Not following any protocol, not having any criteria, not having or abiding by any rules of any kind is leaving a door wide open for Occult mayhem. In my own personal opinion I feel we&#39;re not far from it, if not already in mayhem. I feel it is time we make bigger changes. Changes that will help Wicca grow and prosper in a more positive way. 
It is a vision of mine to see changes taking place in the Wiccan community, changes that will bring the Traditional practices of Wicca back where they use to be and as a result bring a successful religion to the lands we live and to the path and religion that I care so much about. 
Wicca is not the &quot;be all or end all&quot; of Occult paths. 
Wicca is just one Occult path out of many that a person may learn or take.
Learning as much as you can about as many of them as you can is always encouraged. 
But if you are interested in Wicca (in particular) and you live in the United States, it is wise to heed the advice of the older, trained and more experienced long term members of the &quot;Wiccan community&quot; who have practiced (paritcularly here) in the United States.
Due to the the love and passion I have for Wicca, I have been called to write this book.
I would like to thank every person who has been with me through this journey because all of you have contributed in my writing it. Both directly and indirectly. 
A thank you goes out to those of you who have purchased the book. 
I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
**NOTE** ;
If you do not agree with something I have stated in this book and wish to debate it, please be an adult about it and show your level of spiritual maturity by writing your own book in rebuttle to it. If you have something to say in defense or do not agree with something and do not wish to write a book in rebuttle, please refer to the discussion page on Facebook that has been set up so we can talk about it. The one thing that I ask is that you have enough respect for me to not stoop to personal verbal attacks, my training or my own personal experiences and perspectives just because you don&#39;t agree with me! 
I would be most grateful for that! Thanks!
Happy Reading!

  <title>Waking up an Empath - Kim Wuirch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Waking Up an Empath: A Year in the Life of an Empath from Awakening to Spiritual Healer is the honest, often comical year in the life story of Kimberly Wuirch. Having been labeled as sensitive throughout her life, even by her mother, Kimberly finally finds out the reason why her emotions and moods are often heightened. She discovers that she is an empath.
This book is based on one year of Kimberlys lifefrom the shock of finding out she was an empath and learning what that meant, to the journey through spiritual awakening, and finally to becoming a healer, psychic, and medium. 
Her story is relatable to many people who are too afraid to let the world know of their abilities or who are only just discovering who they really are.
Kimberly wrote this book to help other empaths realize that their thoughts, feelings, and sudden mood swings are all a normal part of being an empath and how difficult it is for those on the outside to fully understand what life is like for an empath. In the pages of this book, Kimberly is like the good and knowledgeable friend whom empaths can confide in when it comes to their own spiritual awakening and the fears and challenges that brings up.
There are not only words on the pages of this book. There is also love and compassion for a journey Kimberly knows all too well." />

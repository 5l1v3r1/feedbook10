  <title>THE BLIND LEADING THE BLONDE ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM - Nurit Oren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My spiritual autobiography narrating important events that occurred during my 40 year spiritual search, the mistakes I made and the lessons I learned, and how my path culminated when I finally found the truth I was looking for. The purpose of this book is to inspire other seekers and help them avoid the struggles I went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nurit&amp;rsquo;s book conveys such an important message. Everyone should read it. Immediately after reading it, I invited Nurit to be one of the 17 speakers at the &amp;ldquo;Soul Conference&amp;rdquo; in Budapest, in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This book is the story of Nurit&amp;rsquo;s 40 years of intense spiritual seeking in several countries and with many teachers; the mistakes, the pitfalls and the elusive bliss along the way and, finally, spiritual finding and truths revealed! She holds nothing back. Her entire life is packed into those pages, including how her life changed forever after meeting Hungarian Master of Silence, Gabor Harsanyi. Since Nurit&amp;rsquo;s book depicts such a clear understanding and perception of Gabor&amp;rsquo;s teachings, I have requested Gabor to be the Keynote speaker at this conference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Eva Pap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference Director and Organizer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is always interesting to read adventure stories, and Nurit&amp;#39;s book is certainly that! Spanning more than 40 years of intense spiritual seeking &amp;mdash; in countries throughout the world and with many teachers &amp;mdash; she candidly reports on the good, the bad, and the ugly. Ultimately, we learn that Nurit finds what she has been looking for. It turns out it was right there, inside her, the entire time. She tells of the pitfalls and dead ends of spiritual seeking with raw vulnerability and honesty, and she equally tells of her delight in finding what she so rigorously sought for decades.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert Rabbin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author, Speaker, Creator Of &amp;quot;Speaking Truthfully&amp;quot; And &amp;quot;The 5 Principles of Authentic Living&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The adventures in Nurit&amp;#39;s life are both fascinating as well as enlightening. There is much one can learn from her experience. Having met Gabor and having experienced the peace he exudes and teaches, I can see how she finally found the answers to her quest through him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Zolt&amp;aacute;n Szab&amp;oacute;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Former Deputy Director-General Of The Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I read your book from beginning to end and can&amp;#39;t remember laughing out loud and so hard, ever!&amp;nbsp; Congratulations!

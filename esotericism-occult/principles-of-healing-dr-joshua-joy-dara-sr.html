  <title>Principles of Healing - Dr. Joshua Joy Dara Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years, I was skeptical about divine healing. I thought that it was too good to be true. But one day, I got very sick and I needed help. Like anyone with common sense, I went to the hospital to be treated by medical Doctors. I sought for the best of them because I could afford it and I certainly wanted to live. To my surprise, I found out that those Doctors are humans and they don&#39;t have all the answers. They did the best they could for me but my condition did not improve. So, I sought God and He healed me fully and completely. I discovered that there is something that is impossible with men, but with God, all things are possible. (Luke 18:27)
This book is not intended to bash the medical Doctors. To the contrary, I actually admire them. But for Doctors, many people would have died before their time. So, I am not anti Doctors. Instead, this book is intended to share with you a practical way to get healed. When the Doctors have done all they could do for you, it is good to know that there is a God who can heal your body and He has never lost a patient. More so, God&#39;s method is very effective. He works through Doctors, but He can heal without them. With God, there are no prescription drugs, no recovery room, and no need for a follow up appointment. In short, this book is not a fiction of someone&#39;s imagination. It is a practical guide to God&#39;s divine healing. If you need healing and you really want to know how God can heal you, I seriously encourage you to read this book. Believe me, your life will never be the same again." />

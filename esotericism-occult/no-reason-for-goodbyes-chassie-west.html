  <title>No Reason for Goodbyes - Chassie West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No Reason for Goodbyes - Messages from Beyond Life is a compilation of over one hundred instances of messages or contacts from the departed, submitted by the men and women who experienced them, contributors from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and as far away as Australia. There is Colleen who, during the Arlington National Cemetery memorial service for her father, a veteran of World War II, saw him standing tall and erect in the distance for the playing of the Marine Corps Hymn. And Jacki who, as she knelt to pray the Rosary before bedtime, felt a presence beside her and heard the voice of her late father: Teach me how to say it. And Tylers sister, Robyn, whod died in infancy, sending a message during a television show that she liked the new athletic shoes hed just bought. Incidents such as these leave no doubt of the continuation of life beyond physical death and the assurance that our loved ones remain with us still. 
&lt;p&gt;
Transcripts and detailed messages from the departed, courtesy of well-known psychic mediums during group and one-on-one readings offer further proof of continued life after death. And from Patti Sinclair, a professional psychic medium, along with Dr. Bhrett McCabe, a licensed clinical psychologist and his mother, Mary Jo McCabe, a professional psychic intuitive, we are given sage advice for those among us who are skeptical or grieving. 
&lt;p&gt;
No Reason for Goodbyes strongly suggests that we rethink everything we have believed about the finality of death. It confirms that those who have departed from our physical world can and do reach out and touch, in some cases, quite literally, and that love is indeed eternal. If there was ever a time for a paradigm shift about the way we view death, that time is now." />

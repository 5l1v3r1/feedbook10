  <title>An a to Z of Emotional Freedom - Caroline Anson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The intention of this book is to help you claim back the life of personal respect, integrity and honour you were always destined to live.
&lt;P&gt;
This book is aimed at anyone who has a dream inside waiting to break out but is imprisoned by their personal history.
&lt;P&gt;
It does not aim to provide the answers, but hopes instead to provoke you into asking the right questions about your life and how you really want to live it: The rest is up to you.
&lt;P&gt;
This book is part of a series of four, which are defined as &#39;living books&#39;; in other words, as readers read and learn and grow, and feedback to us, we want to evidence that learning and growing so maybe other peoples&#39; learning and growing can acquire compassion and wisdom about their own and others&#39; lives less painfully.
&lt;P&gt;
As the authors of this book, we have learned certain incontrovertible truths; the most important one being that we are all ultimately responsible for our own life stories. We have the final decision on what story we choose to tell.
&lt;P&gt;
If it is too late to change the chapters that have preceded where we are now, we certainly have the power to transform the rest of the story to describe our blooming. 
&lt;P&gt;
Contained within these pages, and the pages of the other three books comprising the series, are some ideas to help you along the way
&lt;P&gt;
All the words and phrases used throughout the series are intended to be explained within the context of how they are presented. If however, you do not understand anything you read, please ask for an explanation. We will be happy to clarify in later editions and via our website updates.

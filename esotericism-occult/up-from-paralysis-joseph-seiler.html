  <title>Up from Paralysis - Joseph Seiler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joseph shares his experiences with the disease Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) which twice (less than 1 in 1,000,000 chance of this) and very quickly, paralyzed him. He slowly healed. In the paralysis state, his mind was at a heightened level of awareness. Unable to do anything physical, he applied himself to understanding the vivid messages that became so present to him. He provides a chronicle of the GBS, but more, he provides a detailed account of the discoveries made available to him, explained in his own simple language.
Up From Paralysis shares Josephs journey of discovery of how it all works for him, and he suggests for us too, when it comes to listening to that tiny whisper of wisdom some call intuition, Spirit, Guidance from the other side, which is actually inside.
Learn how to, through increased clarity, live a more successful life in all dimensions." />

  <title>The Opposite of Everyone - Joshilyn Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fiercely independent divorce lawyer learns the power of family and connection when she receives a cryptic message from her estranged mother in this bittersweet, witty novel from the nationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Someone Else&amp;#8217;s Love Story&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gods in Alabama&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;an emotionally resonant tale about the endurance of love and the power of stories to shape and transform our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Alabama, Paula Vauss spent the first decade of her life on the road with her free-spirited young mother, Kai, an itinerant storyteller who blended Hindu mythology with southern oral tradition to re-invent their history as they roved. But everything, including Paula&amp;#8217;s birth name Kali Jai, changed when she told a story of her own&amp;#8212;one that landed Kai in prison and Paula in foster care. Separated, each holding secrets of her own, the intense bond they once shared was fractured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Paula has reincarnated herself as a tough-as-nails divorce attorney with a successful practice in Atlanta. While she hasn&amp;#8217;t seen Kai in fifteen years, she&amp;#8217;s still making payments on that Karmic debt&amp;#8212;until the day her last check is returned in the mail, along with a mysterious note: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am going on a journey, Kali. I am going back to my beginning; death is not the end. You will be the end. We will meet again, and there will be new stories. You know how Karma works.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Kai&amp;#8217;s most treasured secret literally lands on Paula&amp;#8217;s doorstep, throwing her life into chaos and transforming her from only child to older sister. Desperate to find her mother before it&amp;#8217;s too late, Paula sets off on a journey of discovery that will take her back to the past and into the deepest recesses of her heart. With the help of her ex-lover Birdwine, an intrepid and emotionally volatile private eye who still carries a torch for her, this brilliant woman, an expert at wrecking families, now has to figure out how to put one back together&amp;#8212;her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Opposite of Everyone&lt;/em&gt; is a story about story itself, how the tales we tell connect us, break us, and define us, and how the endings and beginnings we choose can destroy us . . . and make us whole. Laced with sharp humor and poignant insight, it is beloved &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Joshilyn Jackson at her very best.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Mr. Gwyn - Alessandro Baricco, Ann Goldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;After celebrated author Jasper Gwyn suddenly and publicly announces that he will never write another book, he embarks on a strange new career path as a &amp;#147;copyist,&amp;#8221; holding thirty-day sittings in a meticulously appointed room and producing, at the end, brief but profoundly rich portraits in prose. The surprising, beautiful, and even frightening results are received with rapture by their subjects&amp;#151;among them Gwyn&amp;#8217;s devoted assistant, Rebecca; a beautiful fabric importer; a landscape painter; Gwyn&amp;#8217;s own literary agent; two wealthy newlyweds; a tailor to the Queen; and a very dangerous nineteen-year-old.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then Gwyn disappears, leaving behind only a short note to his assistant&amp;#151;and the portraits. As Rebecca studies his words, she realizes that the mystery is larger than the simple fact of Gwyn&amp;#8217;s whereabouts, and she begins to unravel a lifetime&amp;#8217;s worth of clues left by a man who saw so much but said so little, a man whose solitude masked a heart as hungry as hers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Heat - Steven Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On that road it felt like the only place to go was its eventual end.&amp;rdquo; - from &amp;#39;The Shoe Tree Incident&amp;#39;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Heat, Steve Carr explores character and sorrow. The protagonists&amp;#39; lives had pushed them back into a corner and there was nowhere else for them to go, no matter how much they tried to run, or fight, or bargain their way out. Whether through bad decisions or bad luck, things hadn&amp;rsquo;t turned out so great for them. We all think that we&amp;rsquo;re missing out on something, that better things are out there, if only someone would come along and rescue us. If only something would go in our favor to bring us what we want - but for many of the characters, as in life, it&amp;#39;s the end-of-the road.&lt;/p&gt;" />

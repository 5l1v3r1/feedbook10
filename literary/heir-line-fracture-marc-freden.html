  <title>Heir Line Fracture - Marc Freden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mica Daly is fresh from his scandal-ridden ouster from the hit American entertainment series Drop Zone. But the scandal gave Mica international gravitas and he has landed a new deal as the entertainment host on the daily British morning news program Rise ‘N Shine. And he’s an instant hit with the British audiences. Just call him Freddy. Titled and entitled, international party boy Fredrick Charles Arthur Henry, Duke of Clarence, believes he is the rightful heir to the British throne. And for his silence, Freddy has received his position, a royal apartment and a substantial stipend on which to live. That should be enough...but enough is never enough for the loose lipped Fast Freddy. Edward “Ted” Harrelson is a man of mystery. By admission he works in the Ministry of Defense. Or does he? He frequents the Palace on “official business”; is a member of a prestigious, if not clandestine, members only club in Mayfair; and elicits more questions than offers answers. All-in-all, an explosive exposé of the shadowy world of political intrigue, underground maneuverings and the lengths to which a government will go to silence a truth no one is ready or able to accept." />

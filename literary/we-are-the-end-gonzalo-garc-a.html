  <title>We Are The End - Gonzalo García</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘A unique and  breathtaking talent.’ Scarlett Thomas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Gonzalo Garcia is so talented: a new deep and hilarious literary voice.” Dorthe Nors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomás&#39; girlfriend has left him. She has, in fact, fled to Antarctica, leaving him alone in Santiago, where life is rapidly passing him by.&lt;br&gt;Tomás is a game designer – but he can&#39;t see his ideas through.&lt;br&gt;Tomás also works in a university – where he spends most of his time hiding under a desk.&lt;br&gt; Tomás’ flat is falling apart. The band he used to play in is doing annoyingly well. He drinks coffee though a straw straight from the pot because he doesn&#39;t own a cup...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This smart, funny debut novel from Gonzalo G. Garcia gives a new voice to a disenchanted generation. With its Chilean setting, willingness to play with form and uniquely messed-up central character, it&#39;s unlike anything else. But it&#39;s also universal. Tomás may be someone who ends up sleeping in a tent in his own living room. But his loss and longing, not to mention his jokes, will touch everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" />

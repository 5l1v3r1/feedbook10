  <title>Four Mothers - Shifra Horn, Dalya Bilu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shifra Horn&#39;s beautifully imagined novel tells the story of five generations of women in one family against the backdrop of one hundred years in Jerusalem.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins with the birth of the family&#39;s first boy to Amal, the last generation. Her mother, grandmother and great-grandmother are overjoyed, because the birth of a healthy boy means that the curse against the women of the family has been broken. They tell Amal the story of those &quot;foremothers&quot;:  Mazal, the orphan, whose ill-fated marriage initiates the curse; her daughter Sara, whose golden hair is a symbol for her power to heal; Sara&#39;s daughter Pnina-Mazal, the unwanted child whose talent for knowing others&#39; thoughts brings both joy and sorrow; and her daughter Geula, Amal&#39;s mother, whose sharp intellect is her gift and her burden.&lt;/p&gt;" />

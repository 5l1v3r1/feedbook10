  <title>So Lucky - Nicola Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Hild&lt;/i&gt;, a fierce and urgent autobiographical novel about a woman facing down a formidable foe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Lucky&lt;/i&gt; is the sharp, surprising new novel by Nicola Griffith--the profoundly personal and emphatically political story of a confident woman forced to confront an unnerving new reality when in the space of a single week her wife leaves her and she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mara Tagarelli is, professionally, the head of a multimillion-dollar AIDS foundation; personally, she is a committed martial artist. But her life has turned inside out like a sock. She can&#39;t rely on family, her body is letting her down, and friends and colleagues are turning away--they treat her like a victim. She needs to break that narrative: build her own community, learn new strengths, and fight. But what do you do when you find out that the story you&#39;ve been told, the story you&#39;ve told yourself, is not true? How can you fight if you can&#39;t trust your body? Who can you rely on if those around you don&#39;t have your best interests at heart, and the systems designed to help do more harm than good? Mara makes a decision and acts, but her actions unleash monsters aimed squarely at the heart of her new community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is fiction from the front lines, incandescent and urgent, a narrative juggernaut that rips through sentiment to expose the savagery of America&#39;s treatment of the disabled and chronically ill. But &lt;i&gt;So Lucky&lt;/i&gt; also blazes with hope and a ferocious love of self, of the life that becomes possible when we stop believing lies.&lt;/p&gt;" />

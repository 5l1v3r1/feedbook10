  <title>Releasing Lisa - Richard R. Roach Md Facp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lisa Zuccerelli just wants to be normal. At the end of her senior year in high school, she has the distinction for the most detentions in the history of the school, thanks to an English teachers betrayal. Seemingly left with no other choice after a distressing graduation ceremony, she packs two weeks worth of rations, a canoe, and her broken heart and flees to the Canadian wilderness, where she hopes to piece her life back together and realize happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Lisa paddles her way to a campsite, she is forced to deal with the complex emotions associated with the stigma of a learning disability she can do nothing to change. But as Lisa is about to discover, nature has its own grim way of teaching lessons, and it is not long before she is rescued from the unforgiving wilderness by a kind family who helps her find her way back home. After facing several surprises, Lisa meets Heidi Barton, an Anishinaabe tutor who may just have the healing powers to help release the girl from her strugglesand find her true self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Releasing Lisa&lt;i&gt; shares the tale of a teenagers emotional journey to overcome her learning disability and fears with help from the Canadian wilderness and an Anishinaabe friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />

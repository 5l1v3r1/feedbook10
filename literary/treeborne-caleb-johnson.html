  <title>Treeborne - Caleb Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t remember the last time I read a book I wish so much I&#39;d written. &lt;i&gt;Treeborne&lt;/i&gt; is beautiful, and mythic in ways I would never have been able to imagine...I can&#39;t say enough about this book.&quot;--Daniel Wallace, national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Extraordinary Adventures&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Honorable Mention for the Southern Book Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Southern Living&#39;&lt;/i&gt;s &quot;Best New Books Coming Out Summer 2018&quot; and one of &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &quot;Books to Get Now&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Janie Treeborne lives on an orchard at the edge of Elberta, Alabama, and in time, she has become its keeper. A place where conquistadors once walked, and where the peaches they left behind now grow, Elberta has seen fierce battles, violent storms, and frantic change--and when the town is once again threatened from without, Janie realizes it won&#39;t withstand much more. So she tells the story of its people: of Hugh, her granddaddy, determined to preserve Elberta&#39;s legacy at any cost; of his wife, Maybelle, the postmaster, whose sudden death throws the town into chaos; of her lover, Lee Malone, a black orchardist harvesting from a land where he is less than welcome; of the time when Janie kidnapped her own Hollywood-obsessed aunt and tore the wrong people apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world closes in on Elberta, Caleb Johnson&#39;s debut novel lifts the veil and offers one last glimpse. &lt;i&gt;Treeborne&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration and a reminder: of how the past gets mixed up in thoughts of the future; of how home is a story as much as a place.&lt;/p&gt;" />

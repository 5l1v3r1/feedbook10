  <title>The Writers Afterlife - Richard Vetere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Writers Afterlife&lt;/I&gt; is the story of Tom Chillo, a 44-year-old writer on the verge of fame, who suddenly dies of a stroke and finds himself transported to a place where all writers are sent after they die. After mingling with &amp;#147;The Eternals&amp;#8221; &amp;#151; including Shakespeare, Wilde, Keats, and Tolstoy &amp;#151; he discovers that his true peers in this new world are all haunted by the same regret: they never achieved the fame they felt they deserved during their lifetime. There&amp;#8217;s still a chance, though. Every writer has the opportunity to return to earth for exactly one week and convince someone to set the wheels in motion to give their life&amp;#8217;s work widespread notoriety. The trick is to come up with the perfect plan the first time. Failure is not an option. &lt;I&gt;The Writers Afterlife&lt;/I&gt; is brimming with warm humor, New York street sensibility, and an underlying commentary about the drive for fame in contemporary culture. With a deft hand, Vetere explores the deceptions that people employ to achieve at all costs. A string of eccentric New York characters fly off the page and make for a striking, memorable book that is a delight to read.&lt;/div&gt;" />

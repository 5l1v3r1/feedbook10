  <title>Revenge - Taslima Nasrin, Honor Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Nasrin&#39;s voice is the voice of humanism everywhere.&quot;&amp;#151;Wole Soyinka&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Taslima Nasrin has spoken out about the oppression of women under Islam, and what she&#39;s said needed saying.&quot; &amp;#151;Salman Rushdie&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Revenge is a delicious novel about getting even, from one of the most controversial and internationally acclaimed writers of her generation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In modern Bangladesh, Jhumur marries for love and imagines life with her husband, Haroon, will continue much as it did when they were dating. But once she crosses the threshold of Haroon&amp;#8217;s family home, Jhumur finds she is expected to be the traditional Muslim wife: head covered, eyes averted, and unable to leave the house without an escort. When she becomes pregnant, Jhumur is shocked to discover that Haroon doesn&amp;#8217;t believe the baby is his. Overwhelmed by his mistrust, Jhumur plots her revenge in the arms of a handsome neighbor. Readers will be stunned by this tale of love, lust, and blood ties.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The American Fiancee - Eric Dupont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this extraordinary breakout novel&amp;#8212;a rich, devastatingly humorous epic of one unforgettable family&amp;#8212;award-winning author Eric Dupont illuminates the magic of stories, the bonds of family, and the twists of fate and fortune to transform our lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the twentieth century, three generations of the Lamontagnes will weather love, passion, jealousy, revenge, and death. Their complicated family dynamic&amp;#8212;as dramatic as Puccini&amp;#8217;s legendary opera, &lt;em&gt;Tosca&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;will propel their rise, and fall, and take them around the world . .&amp;#160;. until they finally confront the secrets of their complicated pasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born on Christmas, Louis Lamontagne, the family&amp;#8217;s patriarch, is a larger-than-life lothario and raconteur who inherits his mother&amp;#8217;s teal eyes and his father&amp;#8217;s brutish good looks and whose charms travel beyond Quebec, across the state of New York where he wins at county fairs as a larger-than-life strongman, and even in Europe, where he is deployed for the US Army during World War II. We meet his daughter, Madeleine, who opens a successful chain of diners using the recipes from her grandmother, the original American Fianc&amp;#233;e, and vows never to return to her hometown. And we end with her son Gabriel, another ladies&amp;#8217; man in the family, who falls in love with a woman he follows to Berlin and discovers unexpected connections there to the Lamontagne family that re-frame the entire course of the events in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unholy marriage of John Irving and Gary Shteyngart with the irresistible whimsy of Elizabeth McCracken, &lt;em&gt;The American Fianc&amp;#233;e&lt;/em&gt; is a big, bold, wildly ambitious novel that introduces a dynamic new voice to contemporary literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />

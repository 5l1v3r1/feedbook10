  <title>What is Going to Happen Next - Karen Hofmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Karen Hofmann&#39;s empathetic and cathartic novel, &lt;i&gt;What is Going to Happen Next&lt;/i&gt;, pieces together the lives of five members of the Lund family following their enforced dispersal after the death of the father and the hospitalization of the mother in the remote West Coast community of Butterfly Lake. It explores their self-doubts and aspirations in the ways they cope with their separation and reunion through their work and personal relationships, and reveals the ways in which their past is filtered through memory and desire. It also skillfully exposes a Vancouver class system from the perspectives of diverse socio-economic conditions and lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is Going to Happen Next&lt;/i&gt; is character-driven and well-wrought, with a tenderness that propels the reader forward alongside the Lunds who are learning to fuse together as a chosen family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;What is Going to Happen Next&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a novel that&#39;s as original as it is ambitious, and it works, resulting in an all-engrossing visceral reading experience, and I&#39;m recommending it to everyone.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Kerry Clare, &lt;i&gt;Pickle Me This&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The characters as so unique from one another, each with a distinct voice and personality.... I would highly recommend this wonderful piece of Canadian fiction.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Jaaron Collins, &lt;i&gt;Worn Pages and Ink&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;As a family saga, the novel is empathetic, compassionate, and expertly paced.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Brenda Johnston, &lt;i&gt;Canadian Literature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

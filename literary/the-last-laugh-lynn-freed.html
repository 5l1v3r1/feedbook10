  <title>The Last Laugh - Lynn Freed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;*A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Editor&#39;s Choice*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the award-winning author Lynn Freed, who&#39;s been called a &quot;literary star&quot; by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt;, comes a hilarious and brilliant new novel about the riotous, passion-filled adventures of three women who &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; they were past their prime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To escape their griping grown children, husbands and lovers, and an abundance of grandchildren underfoot, three self-proclaimed &quot;old bags,&quot; Dania, Ruth, and Bess, head for a quiet island on the Aegean Sea. They&#39;ll spend a year by the water--watching the sunset, eating grilled fish and fresh olives, sipping ouzo. They deserve it, they say. After all those years, the three women will finally have some peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that they can&#39;t. For one, Bess, a pampered, once-beautiful inheritress, falls swiftly into an affair with a poetry-writing taxi driver--who has, of course, a territorial wife. And Dania, a therapist, begins to receive an increasing number of cryptically menacing phone calls from a psychotic patient. An ex-lover of Ruth&#39;s shows up unexpectedly, right before one of Bess&#39;s does--and then the women&#39;s children arrive, with their own demanding children in tow. As the island quickly becomes crowded, the women&#39;s serene year in Greece devolves perilously, and uproariously, into something much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the wit of Maria Semple&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Today Will Be &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Different&lt;/i&gt; and all the adventure of Deborah Moggach&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&lt;/i&gt;, Lynn Freed&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Last &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laugh &lt;/i&gt;is at once wildly funny and deeply perceptive, an exuberant story of friendship and pleasure, family and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Language of Threads - Gail Tsukiyama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers of &lt;i&gt;Women of the Silk&lt;/i&gt; never forgot the moving, powerful story of Pei, brought to work in the silk house as a girl, grown into a quiet but determined young woman whose life is subject to cruel twists of fate, including the loss of her closest friend, Lin.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in bestselling novelist Gail  Tsukiyama&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Language of Threads&lt;/i&gt;, we finally learn what happened to Pei, as she leaves the silk house for  Hong Kong in the 1930s, arriving with a young orphan, Ji Shen, in her  care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Her first job, in the home of a wealthy family, ends in disgrace, but soon Pei and Ji Shen find a new life in the home of Mrs. Finch, a British ex-patriate who welcomes them as the daughters she  never had. Their idyllic life is interrupted, however, by war, and the Japanese occupation. Pei is once again forced to make her own way, struggling to survive and to keep her extended family alive as well. In this story of hardship and survival, Tsukiyama paints a portrait of women fighting the forces of war and time to make a life for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Often scorned by neighbors for her family&amp;#8217;s erratic and eccentric behavior&amp;#8212;such as her father Johnny&amp;#8217;s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy&amp;#8217;s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce&amp;#8212;no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans&amp;#8217; life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans&amp;#8217; daily experiences are tenderly threaded with family connectedness and raw with honesty. Betty Smith has, in the pages of &lt;em&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/em&gt;, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life-from &amp;#8220;junk day&amp;#8221; on Saturdays, when the children of Francie&amp;#8217;s neighborhood traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry. Betty Smith has artfully caught this sense of exciting life in a novel of childhood, replete with incredibly rich moments of universal experiences&amp;#8212;a truly remarkable achievement for any writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />

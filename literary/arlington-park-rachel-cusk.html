  <title>Arlington Park - Rachel Cusk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arlington Park, a modern-day English suburb very much like its American counterparts, is a place devoted to the profitable ordinariness of life. Amidst its leafy avenues and comfortable houses, its residents live out the dubious accomplishments of civilization: material prosperity, personal freedom, and moral indifference. In Arlington Park, men work, women look after children, and people generally do what&#39;s expected of them. It&#39;s a world awash in contentment but empty of belief, and riven with strange anxieties. How are they to know right from wrong?  How should they use their knowledge of other people&#39;s sufferings? What is the relationship of politics to their own domestic arrangements? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set over the course of a single rainy day, the novel moves from one household to another, and through the passing hours conducts a deep examination of its characters&#39; lives: of Juliet, enraged at the victory of men over women in family life; of Amanda, warding off thoughts of death with obsessive housework; of Solly, who confronts her own buried femininity in the person of her Italian lodger; of Maisie, despairing at the inevitability with which beauty is destroyed; and of Christine, whose troubled, hilarious spirit presides over Arlington Park and the way of life it represents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkly comic, deeply affecting, and wise, &lt;i&gt;Arlington&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Park&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning imagining of the extraordinary inner nature of ordinary life, by one of Britain&#39;s most exciting young novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />

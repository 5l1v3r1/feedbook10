  <title>The Baby Agenda (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (9 Months Later, Book 65) - Janice Kay Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;One of Moira Cullen&#39;s few walks on the wild side has come back to haunt her. Now she has to tell the man who rescued her from a disastrous evening he&#39;s going to be a father. Not the best thank-you she can give Will Becker.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He proves her instincts were sharp the night she took a chance on him. Not only does he commit to being involved with their baby, he also returns from his dream job in Africa to do it. He&#39;s a good man…perhaps &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;good. Moira has to wonder if he&#39;s here because he wants to be or because he always does the right thing. And the way she&#39;s falling for him, she wants a marriage…for real.&lt;/p&gt;

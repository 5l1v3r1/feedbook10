  <title>Confessions of a Memory Eater - Pagan Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Complicated, cool and vulnerable at the same time...you can&#39;t help falling for Pagan Kennedy&#39;s characters.&quot;&amp;mdash;Stephen Dubner, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a brilliant historian with a promising academic future, Win Duncan is at a crossroads in his career when he is mysteriously summoned by Litminov, a wild but brilliant chemist from his college days. Litminov has made millions since, and has bought a pharmaceutical company solely to develop MEM, an experimental drug that gives one the ability to recall life&amp;rsquo;s best memories with crystal clarity. Duncan becomes a beta tester and loses himself to the most delicious moments of his past&amp;mdash;those precious few years with his mother who died tragically when he was just a child; ecstatic sex with his wife when they first fell in love&amp;mdash;until he discovers the dark side effects of a drug that turns the past into pornography and renders the present useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proven master of underground lit, beat fiction and narrative non-fiction, Pagan Kennedy takes on America&amp;rsquo;s obsession with the idealized past with freshness, wit, and an uncanny ability to measure the pulse of post-modern culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Pagan Kennedy&lt;/b&gt; is the author of seven books. The most recent, &lt;i&gt;Black Livingstone&lt;/i&gt;, was a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book and a winner of the Massachusetts Book Award. Her novel &lt;i&gt;Spinsters&lt;/i&gt; won a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Discover Award and was shortlisted for the Orange Prize, Britain&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious literary award. Her articles appear regularly in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Nation&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Spin&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Salon&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

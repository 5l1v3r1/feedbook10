      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A magical, inventive novel about one man&#39;s struggle to find his place in the small Indian village of his birth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Anita Nair&#39;s warm and imaginative first novel, middle-aged Acuthan Nair returns home to restore his childhood house and to confront old ghosts.  When he begins the project, he hires the town painter, One-Screw-Loose Bhasi, to oversee the renovation, and the two men quickly develop a close friendship.  Bhasi, who has a special talent for healing the wounded, helps Acuthan come to terms with his mother&#39;s violent death and teaches him how to stand up to his overbearing, manipulative father.  But when members of the town elite tempt Acuthan with a chance at gaining the status he&#39;s always craved, his loyalty to Bhasi is tested. &lt;i&gt; The Better Man&lt;/i&gt; is a playful and moving account of the redemptive power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;" />

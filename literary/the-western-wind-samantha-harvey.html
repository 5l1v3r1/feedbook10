  <title>The Western Wind - Samantha Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Western Wind&lt;/i&gt; has been singled out by the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; in a preview of “best fiction in 2018” and the books editor at &lt;i&gt;The Bookseller&lt;/i&gt; chose it as her book of the year, the book that deserves to break out Harvey to a wider audience&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvey has been praised by Michael Cunningham, Tessa Hadley, and AM Holmes; James Wood raved about &lt;i&gt;Dear Thief&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, where he called Harvey’s prose “luminous” and “rich but always lucid” and said that he “was at moments reminded of Marilynne Robinson”&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Thief&lt;/i&gt; was shortlisted for the James Tait Black Prize and longlisted for the Bailey’s Prize for Women’s Fiction&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvey’s 2009 debut &lt;i&gt;The Wilderness&lt;/i&gt; won the Betty Trask Prize; it was shortlisted for the Orange Prize, the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; First Book Award, and longlisted for the Man Booker Prize&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvey has a postgraduate degree in philosophy and her insightful, contemplative approach to story has earned her comparisons to Virginia Woolf, Marilynne Robinson, WG Sebald, Claire Messud, John Banville, and Joseph O’Neill&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Western Wind&lt;/i&gt; is both a propulsive medieval mystery and a meditation on faith and existence that will appeal to readers of Eleanor Catton, Sarah Waters, and Donna Tartt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set in 1491, the year Henry VIII was born, Harvey places the plot in the run-up to Lent, and tells it through the voice of a village priest and confessor; the novel subtly foreshadows the events of the English Reformation, which would take place approximately within the next four decades&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvey teaches creative writing at Bath Spa University in the UK; she was a member of the jury for the 2016 Giller Prize&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her stories have appeared in &lt;i&gt;Granta&lt;/i&gt; and on BBC Radio4" />

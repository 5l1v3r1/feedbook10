  <title>The Ice Bridge: A Novel - D.R. Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Anna Starling flees a dissolving marriage in California to save herself and her artistic career, and rents a house in the isolated landscape of Cape Breton. There, her life intersects with that of her neighbor Red Murdock, a cabinetmaker who has recently lost Rosaire, the great love of his life, to cancer. Surrounded by the old ghosts of this landscape and the echoes of the indigenous Scottish culture that once lived in this isolated community, Anna and Murdock slowly come together just as the modern world encroaches on their town. When a local drug-smuggling ring starts to impede on their natural landscape, Anna finds herself caught in the crosshairs, and both she and Murdock must shake off the past in order to contend with the dark forces swirling all around them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Part love story, part moral fable, and part quest for home and heart, &lt;I&gt;The Ice Bridge&lt;/I&gt; is a superbly crafted tale of love after love, a novel rich in atmosphere and infused with lyrical descriptions of land and sea. It is about timeless characters caught in a distinctly modern world. Written with an ear for the cadences of Cape Breton and a profound understanding of the many emotional shadings that exist between the sexes, &lt;I&gt;The Ice Bridge&lt;/I&gt; is another superb work from D.R. MacDonald.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

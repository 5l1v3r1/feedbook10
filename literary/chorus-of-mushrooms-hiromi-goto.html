  <title>Chorus of Mushrooms - Hiromi Goto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since its publication in 1994, Hiromi Goto&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Chorus of Mushrooms&lt;/i&gt; has been recognized as a true classic of Canadian literature. One of the initial entries in NeWest Press&#39; long-running Nunatak First Fiction Series, Hiromi Goto&#39;s inaugural outing was recognized at the Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prizes as the Best First Book in the Caribbean and Canadian regions that year, as well as becoming co-winner of the Canada-Japan book award. Goto&#39;s acclaimed feminist novel is an examination of the Japanese Canadian immigrant experience, focusing on the lives of three generations of women in modern day Alberta to better understand themes of privilege and cultural identity. This reprinting of the landmark text includes an extensive afterword by Larissa Lai and an interview with the author, talking about the impact the book has had on the Canadian literary landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Chorus of Mushrooms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Such a love for words is evident in &lt;i&gt;Chorus of Mushrooms&lt;/i&gt;, which contains passages of breathtaking beauty.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hiromi Goto expertly layers the experiences of a Japanese immigrant woman, her emotionally estranged daughter and her beloved granddaughter into a complex fabric and compelling story.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Ottawa Citizen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Not only is Goto&#39;s language precise and evocative, she has crafted a complex and poetic text that weaves realities and mysteries into a subtle pattern.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Edmonton Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Colony - Jillian Weise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Anne Hatley is a sharp-witted and acerbic young teacher from the South, in need of a reprieve from the drudgery of work and an increasingly tedious relationship. She accepts an invitation to the nation&amp;#8217;s largest research colony, where scientists&amp;#151;DNA pioneer James D. Watson among them&amp;#151;hope to &amp;#147;cure&amp;#8221; Anne of a rare gene that affects her bone growth: She is missing a leg and walks with a prosthesis. Anne feels fine the way she is, and she strives to maintain her resolve under pressure from her peers and from doctors eager to pioneer an experimental procedure, which would make her the first patient to generate a new leg. Meanwhile, she falls into a reluctant romance with the rakish Nick, possessor of the &amp;#147;suicide gene&amp;#8221;; befriends Charles Darwin, who is on site digging through the eugenics archive; and attempts to come to terms with her first love.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Colony&lt;/I&gt; is the story of one young woman struggling to accept who she is, and who she will become. But it is also a novel that mines some of the most polarizing issues of our time&amp;#151;among them, medical ethics, body image, and genetic engineering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Colony - Jillian Weise</i></b> | Jillian Weise’s The Colony does everything that fans of the traditional novel look for: it’s a coming-of-age tale, a razor-sharp comedy of eros, a meditation on 'disability' and the misguided ways in which we purport to 'fix' it, a scorched-earth denunciation of eugenics.<br /><b><i>The Colony: Weise, Jillian: 9781593762674: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Jillian Weise is a skilled writer, a keen observer of the human condition, and a smart and sassy reviewer of the ridiculous. I haven't found many modern novels that feature fully-formed women. Dimensional, complicated, rich, vital woman. Anne Hatley is at the top of that list.<br /><b><i>The Colony by Jillian Weise - Goodreads</i></b> | Praise for The Colony: "Jillian Weise is a troublemaker. We need more writers like her, more novels like her hilarious, deeply moving, sexy, scary novel The Colony , which is about gene therapy, Watson and Crick, excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, mortality, finding love, finding a home, finding family, and all the other doomed experiments we conduct in the hope in making a better human."<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Colony - Jillian Weise</a> </h3></p><hr/>

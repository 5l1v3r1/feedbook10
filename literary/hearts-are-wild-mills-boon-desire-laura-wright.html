          &lt;strong&gt;Maggie Conner might not have had much experience with men - okay, so she&#39;d had absolutely no experience with men - but that didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t find love matches for her female clients. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All she needed was the right man. Trouble was, she&#39;d found exactly the wrong man - Nick Kaplan, a hard-muscled, love-&#39;em-and-leave-&#39;em type with a dangerously seductive smile. Not only was Nick pure temptation in a leather jacket, he was also Maggie&#39;s new roommate!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why not make him over into somebody else&#39;s perfect man? Well, for one thing, the more up-close-and-personal time they spent together, the more Maggie wanted to keep Nick all to herself.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Paris Trance - Geoff Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People talk about love at first sight, about the way that men and women fall for each other immediately, but there is also such a thing as friendship at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke moves to Paris with the idea of writing a novel but things get in the way. He becomes friends with a fellow expatriate, Alex; then he falls in love with Nicole. Alex meets Sahra, and the two couples form an intimacy that changes their lives. As they discover the clubs and cafés of the eleventh arrondissement, the four become inseparable, united by deeply held convictions about dating strategies, tunneling in P.O.W. films, and, crucially, the role of the Styrofoam cup in action movies. Experiencing the exhilarating highs of Ecstasy and sex, they reach a peak of rapture-the comedown from which is unexpected and devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Geoff Dyer fixes a dream of happiness-and its aftermath-with photographic precision. Boldly erotic and hauntingly elegiac, comic and romantic, &lt;i&gt;Paris Trance&lt;/i&gt; confirms Dyer as one of England&#39;s most original and talented writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>America Was Hard to Find - Kathleen Alcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the wake of an affair, the lives of an astronaut and a radical are forever altered by the political fault lines of the 1960s, setting off a series of events ricocheting from anti-Vietnam activism to the Apollo program to the AIDS crisis, in this sprawling multigenerational novel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador, 1969: An American expatriate, Fay Fern, sits in the corner of a restaurant, she and her young son Wright turned away from the television where Vincent Kahn becomes the first man to walk on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years earlier, Fay and Vincent meet at a pilots&amp;#8217; bar in the Mojave Desert. Both seemed poised for reinvention&amp;#8212;the married test pilot, Vincent, as an astronaut; the spurned child of privilege, Fay, as an activist. Their casual affair ends quickly, but its consequences linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though their lives split, their senses of purpose deepen in tandem, each becoming heroes to different sides of the political spectrum of the 1960s and 70s: Vincent an icon with no plan beyond the mission for which he has single-mindedly trained, Fay a leader of a violent leftist group whose anti-Vietnam actions make her one of the FBI&amp;#8217;s most wanted. With her last public appearance, a demonstration that frames the Apollo program as a vehicle for distracting the American public from its country&amp;#8217;s atrocities, Fay leaves Wright to contend with her legacy, his own growing apathy, and the misdeeds of both his mother and his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immense, vivid reimagining of the Cold War era, &lt;em&gt;America Was Hard to Find&lt;/em&gt; traces the fallout of the cultural revolution that divided the country and explores the meaning of individual lives in times of upheaval. It also confirms Kathleen Alcott&amp;#8217;s reputation as a fearless and vital voice in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

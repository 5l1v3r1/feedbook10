  <title>The News Where You Are - Catherine O&#39;Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;What Was Lost&lt;/i&gt; comes a spirited literary mystery about a television anchorman&#39;s search for the truth about the disappearances that surround him &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Allcroft, a television news anchor in his hometown (where he reports on hard-hitting events, like the opening of canine gyms for overweight pets), is on the verge of a mid-life crisis. Beneath his famously corny on-screen persona, Frank is haunted by loss: the mysterious hit-and-run that killed his predecessor and friend, Phil, and the ongoing demolition of his architect father&#39;s monumental postwar buildings. And then there are the things he &lt;i&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; seem to lose, no matter how hard he tries: his home, for one, on the market for years; and the nagging sense that he will never quite be the son his mother--newly ensconced in an assisted-living center--wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Frank uncovers the shocking truth behind Phil&#39;s death, and comes to terms with his domineering father&#39;s legacy, it is his beloved young daughter, Mo, who points him toward the future. Funny and touching, &lt;i&gt;The News Where You Are&lt;/i&gt; is a moving exploration of what we do and don&#39;t leave behind, proving once more that Catherine O&#39;Flynn&#39;s writing &quot;shimmers with dark brilliance&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The News Where You Are&lt;/i&gt; is a 2011 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Paperback Original.&lt;/p&gt;" />

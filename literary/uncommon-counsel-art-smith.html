  <title>Uncommon Counsel - Art Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rip Taylor is a successful Colorado Springs defense attorney. He loves opera but hates the abusive voices and disembodied faces that constantly haunt him: schizophrenia has been part of his life for years. Medications help, but at a cost&amp;mdash;a tradeoff his psychiatrist refuses to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rip&amp;rsquo;s only allies are Mara and Kala, a mysterious pair of jays who visit Rip and provide information about his cases. Other people see and hear the birds, but only Rip understands what Mara and Kala are saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rip loses access to their advice, he strays into an ethical dilemma. He must decide whether to act as his profession demands or to defend what he believes is a greater good. His choice kindles an unlikely partnership and a new direction for his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

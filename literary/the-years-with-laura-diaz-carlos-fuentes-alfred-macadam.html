  <title>The Years with Laura Diaz - Carlos Fuentes, Alfred MacAdam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A radiant and epic new novel that is among the finest achievements of Mexico&#39;s greatest man of letters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Years With Laura Diaz &lt;/i&gt;is Carlos Fuentes&#39; most important novel in several decades.  Like his masterpiece The Death of Artemio Cruz, the action begins in the state of Veracruz and moves to Mexico City--tracing a migration during the Revolution and its aftermath that was a feature of Mexico&#39;s demographic history and that is a significant element in Fuentes&#39;s fictional world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the principle figure is not Artemio Cruz (who, however, makes a brief appearance) but Fuentes&#39;s first major female protagonist, the extraordinary Laura Diaz. Carlos Fuentes&#39;s richly woven narrative tapestry-filled with a multitude of dramatic scenes both witty, amusing, and heartbreaking-shows us this wonderful creature as she grows into a politically committed artist who is also a wife and mother, a lover of great men, a complicated and alluring heroine whose brave honesty  prevails despite her losing a son and grandson to the darkest forces of Mexico&#39;s repressive, corrupt regimes.  In the end, Laura Diaz herself dies, after a life filled with tragedy and loss, but she is a happy woman, for she has borne witness to, and helped to affect, the course of history and has vindicated the aims and intentions of the highest art.&lt;/p&gt;" />

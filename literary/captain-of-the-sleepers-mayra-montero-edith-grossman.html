  <title>Captain of the Sleepers - Mayra Montero, Edith Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For fifty years, Andres Yasin has carried a grudge against J.T. Bunker. Now, Bunker, eighty-two years old and dying of cancer, wants to tell his side of a story, a story of his affair with Andres&#39;s mother. As a child Andres knew Bunker as the &quot;Captain of the Sleepers&quot;-so called because he transported the bodies of those who had died off the island, but wished to be buried at home. But what really happened between Bunker and Andres&#39;s mother, between his mother and her next lover, a leader in the Puerto Rican Nationalistic Insurrection, and what were the actual circumstances of Andres&#39;s mother&#39;s mysterious death?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this taut, erotic novel that slips effortlessly between past and present, remembrance and reality, Mayra Montero describes a feverish Caribbean childhood of secrets, disillusionment, and sexual awakening. Beautifully translated by Edith Grossman, &lt;i&gt;The Captain of the Sleepers&lt;/i&gt; confirms Montero&#39;s stature as one of our finest prose stylists and as an international writer of the first rank.&lt;/p&gt;" />

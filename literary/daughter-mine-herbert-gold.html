  <title>Daughter Mine - Herbert Gold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dan Shaper, bachelor, translator for the San Francisco courts, is a man who has worn the same raincoat for fifteen years, eats the same breakfast in the same coffeeshop every morning, occasionally sees a few long-time men friends and vaguely regrets a handful of former women lovers.  In the sixties and seventies, Shaper was where the action was, (San Francisco, where else?)  and joined in the festivities, if moderately.  But that was a long time ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those who have drug flashbacks, even years after they&#39;ve been using.  Shaper has escaped those, thanks to his moderation.  But into his relatively Spartan life now comes a flashback of another kind - a nineteen-year-old daughter whose existence he never suspected.  Her mother was an overnight acquaintance whom with some effort he manages, barely, to recall.  The daughter&#39;s name is Amanda, and her phone call sends Shaper&#39;s drab-gray existence into dazzling Technicolor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda arrives trailing a motley band of associates: a con man who explains his activities on his gypsy heritage, except that he may not have one; his blatantly seductive daughter; Amanda&#39;s boyfriend, D&#39;Wayne, a streetsmart and (usually) genial black giant.  The con man owns what he has named The Yerba Buena Foundation, dedicated to helping businessmen relieve stress; his daughter - well, she runs the place,  D&#39;Wayne is the house&#39;s security man.  Others turn up, segueing from various areas of Shaper&#39;s life. Amanda, part typical teenager, part young receptacle of ancient wisdom, is currently employed as a &quot;therapist&quot; at the Foundation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaper plunges into this personal mosh pit like a repentant sinner at a river baptism, the shock of his plunge awakening him to the realization that there&#39;s more in life than was dreamt of in his philosophy.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold has been blessing readers with his contemplation of the human condition for many years.  In this novel his lovely humor and deep understanding illuminates how a man walking a barren highway may react when fate suddenly shoves him onto an unpaved, rutted dirt road.&lt;/p&gt;" />

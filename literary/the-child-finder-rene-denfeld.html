  <title>The Child Finder - Rene Denfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A haunting, richly atmospheric, and deeply suspenseful novel from the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Enchanted&lt;/em&gt; about an investigator who must use her unique insights to find a missing little girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Where are you, Madison Culver? Flying with the angels, a silver speck on a wing? Are you dreaming, buried under snow? Or&amp;#8212;is it possible&amp;#8212;you are still alive?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Madison Culver disappeared when her family was choosing a Christmas tree in Oregon&amp;#8217;s Skookum National Forest. She would be eight-years-old now&amp;#8212;if she has survived. Desperate to find their beloved daughter, certain someone took her, the Culvers turn to Naomi, a private investigator with an uncanny talent for locating the lost and missing. Known to the police and a select group of parents as &quot;the Child Finder,&quot; Naomi is their last hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naomi&amp;#8217;s methodical search takes her deep into the icy, mysterious forest in the Pacific Northwest, and into her own fragmented past. She understands children like Madison because once upon a time, she was a lost girl, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Naomi relentlessly pursues and slowly uncovers the truth behind Madison&amp;#8217;s disappearance, shards of a dark dream pierce the defenses that have protected her, reminding her of a terrible loss she feels but cannot remember. If she finds Madison, will Naomi ultimately unlock the secrets of her own life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in the alternating voices of Naomi and a deeply imaginative child, &lt;em&gt;The Child Finder&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking, exquisitely rendered literary page-turner about redemption, the line between reality and memories and dreams, and the human capacity to survive.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Mayor of Olongapo - Hamlin Tallent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1976 when junior navy officer Jack Blue Morrison is crewed with Magic Sharentino, the hero of his fighter squadron, and tasked to fly off his aircraft carrier to the Philippine port city of Olongapo to secure a gift for the ships departing admiral. Home to thousands of hookers, Olongapo is notorious for being an adult Disneyland, where the American dollar buys anythingincluding lust. Blue is the envy of all his friends, but he has no idea there is a dark side to Olongapo, where he is about to break the ultimate taboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue lands in paradise and soon learns that there are many traditions on Olongapo that must be followed. But after he meets beautiful Filipina Lori Santiago and quickly falls in love, he tosses tradition aside and crosses a forbidden line. Now he must overcome the resentment of his commanders and face his own weaknesses as he uncovers the tragic tale of his squadron hero. As if that were not enough, Blue soon realizes that Loris father harbors a long-held grudge against Americans that he has no intention of dropping for the sake of his daughters new love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling tale, a young naval aviator is propelled into an unforgettable internal journey through love, loss, and change as he quickly learns more about himself than he ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />

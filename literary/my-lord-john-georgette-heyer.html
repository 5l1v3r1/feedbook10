  <title>My Lord John - Georgette Heyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are heroes and villains but only one king...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John, Duke of Bedford, grew to manhood fighting for his father, King Henry IV of England, on the wild and lawless Northern Marches. He was a prince of the royal blood, loyal, strong, and the greatest ally that his brother?the future Henry V?was to have. Filled with the clash of bitter rivalries and deadly power struggles, this is Georgette Heyer&#39;s last and most ambitious novel, bringing to life a character and a period she found irresistibly attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus reading group guide available inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRAISE FOR GEORGETTE HEYER &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wonderful characters, elegant, witty writing, perfect period detail, and rapturously romantic.

Childhood was short, apparently, in those long-ago times.

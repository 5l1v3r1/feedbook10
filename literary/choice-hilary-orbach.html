  <title>Choice - Hilary Orbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s in America, anti-abortion sentiments led to increasing violence toward clinics and the caregivers who bravely defied public opposition. In this novel, three people with their own compelling backgrounds are drawn into the struggle.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil&lt;/b&gt;, an idealistic young doctor committed to womens reproductive choice, thinks hes ready for anything when he opens his clinic in eastern New York State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt;, another doctor in their residency, with an unwanted pregnancy in her own family, finds her commitment to choice merged with an unspoken love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adele&lt;/b&gt; struggles to support Phils choice of work, but with growing resentment longs for calm and safety around the birth of her own child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of escalating threats and protests, the world of the clinic is upended when a young patients problem and an eager staff members empathy lead inexorably to a startling act of violence. As Phil, Jenna and Adele confront the tragedy, the grief and despair left in its wake threaten both the clinic and their relationships. Each finds personal choices to make, driven by desire, loyalty, and lossuntil another act of violence changes the direction of each life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

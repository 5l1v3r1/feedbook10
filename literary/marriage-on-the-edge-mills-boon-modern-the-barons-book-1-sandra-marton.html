  <title>Marriage On The Edge (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Barons, Book 1) - Sandra Marton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Gage Baron has made it on his own. He&#39;s wealthy, and his marriage seems successful, too–until Natalie leaves him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Gage receives an invitation to his father&#39;s Texas estate; Jonas obviously has more on his mind than just his eighty-fifth birthday celebration. But the possibility he might inherit Espada is less important to Gage than the opportunity to win back Natalie. Jonas will expect to see her, so Gage must ensure that his wife is back by his side, still married to him–for convenience&#39;s sake….&lt;/p&gt;

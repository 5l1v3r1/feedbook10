  <title>Mr. Potter - Jamaica Kincaid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of an ordinary man, his century, and his home: &quot;Kincaid&#39;s most poetic and affecting novel to date&quot; (Robert Antoni, The Washington Post Book World)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamaica Kincaid&#39;s first obssession, the island of Antigua, comes vibrantly to life under the gaze of Mr. Potter, an illiterate taxi chauffeur who makes his living along the roads that pass through the only towns he has ever seen and the graveyard where he will be buried. The sun shines squarely overhead, the ocean lies on every side, and suppressed passion fills the air.&lt;br&gt;Ignoring the legacy of his father, a poor fisherman, and his mother, who committed suicide, Mr. Potter struggles to live at ease amid his surroundings: to purchase a car, to have girlfriends, and to shake off the encumbrance of his daughters--one of whom will return to Antigua after he dies and tell his story with equal measures of distance and sympathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Mr. Potter&lt;/i&gt;, Kincaid breathes life into a figure unlike any other in contemporary fiction, an individual consciousness emerging gloriously out of an unexamined life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

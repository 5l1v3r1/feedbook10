  <title>Closed Doors - Lisa O&#39;Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young boy on a small Scottish island where everyone knows everything about everyone else, will discover that a secret is a dangerous thing in this tense and brilliant tale of from Lisa O&#39;Donnell, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Death of Bees&lt;/em&gt;, winner of the 2013 Commonwealth Book Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Michael Murray is the best at two things: keepy-uppies and keeping secrets. His family thinks he&#39;s too young to hear grown-up stuff, but he listens at doors; it&#39;s the only way to find out anything. And Michael&#39;s heard a secret, one that might explain the bruises on his mother&#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the whispers at home and on the street become too loud to ignore, Michael begins to wonder if there is an even bigger secret waiting to be discovered. Scared of what might happen if anyone finds out, and desperate for life to be normal again, Michael sets out to piece together the truth. But he also has to prepare for the upcoming talent show, keep an eye out for Dirty Alice, his arch-nemesis, and avoid eating Granny&#39;s watery stew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closed Doors&lt;/em&gt; is a vivid evocation of the fears and freedoms of childhood and a powerful tale of love, the loss of innocence, and the importance of family in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;" />

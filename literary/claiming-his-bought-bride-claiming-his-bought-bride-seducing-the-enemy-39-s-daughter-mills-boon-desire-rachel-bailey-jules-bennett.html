          &lt;strong&gt;Claiming His Bought Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tycoon Damon Blakely had one year to produce a legitimate heir. Luckily he had a bride in mind. Lily Grayson had been the perfect mistress…until she’d left him. And when he proposed his plan, Damon learned why. Lily was already expecting his baby. She agreed to give their child his name…but theirs would be a paper marriage!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Seducing the Enemy’s Daughter &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brady Stone, business magnate, had been planning his revenge for years. Now the only thing standing between Brady and victory was a beautiful, innocent but desirable pawn. His head told him to forget about any possible future with Samantha. But his heart knew that in destroying the Donovan empire he might be ruining his chance at happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

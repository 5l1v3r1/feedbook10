          &lt;strong&gt;FAMILY MAN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;If wishes were horses&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The child&#39;s wish:&lt;/strong&gt; A pony of her own. For her twelfth birthday–just as her father had promised years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The father&#39;s wish:&lt;/strong&gt; A safe and happy life for his daughter. That&#39;s all Mike Whitten&#39;s ever wanted. And that means keeping her away from Liz Matthews and her &quot;germ-filled&quot; camp for young horselovers. It also means breaking his promise–a promise made in haste–at a time when Mike would have done &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to bring a smile to his child&#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woman&#39;s wish:&lt;/strong&gt; That Mike would &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; treating his daugther as though she were made of glass. And–if Liz Matthews could sneak in a second wish–that he would &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; looking at Liz as more than just his daughter&#39;s riding teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;A wonderful romance. Strong. Emotional. Superb. A real page-turner.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;–Patricia Potter, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Starcatcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Carolyn McSparren is a terrific, talented newcomer who has a gift for finding the emotional compass of a story.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

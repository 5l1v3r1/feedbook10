  <title>Juno&#39;s Swans - Tamsen Wolff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1988, before her senior year of high school, Nina and her best friend spend the summer alone on Cape Cod. Nina has grown up with her ailing grandmother-and she yearns for the chance of a deeper connection. When she enrolls in an acting course, she soon finds romance with Sarah, one of the teaching assistants.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nina&#39;s own world revolves around Sarah, while the rest of the world moves urgently on. Nina&#39;s high school teacher does not take the end of their relationship well; her best friend feels abandoned; the AIDS epidemic rages; her fellow actors grow and hone their talents. The novel perfectly captures the revelatory feelings that arrive with young adulthood - the startling awareness of oneself outside the bounds of friends and family, and the twin senses of loneliness and liberation that accompany this knowledge. After a summer of love and loss, Nina slowly finds her way back home.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With lyrical prose, nuanced characters, and an evocative narrative voice, Tamsen Wolff vividly brings to life the dizzying experience of first love-and its inevitable partner, first heartbreak. This honest depiction of female relationships-both romantic and platonic-will capture readers from fifteen to fifty. &lt;i&gt;Juno&#39;s Swans&lt;/i&gt; is rich and sharp and emotional in all the right places.&lt;p&gt;" />

LONGLISTED FOR THE CENTER FOR FICTION&#39;S FIRST NOVEL PRIZE. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the Best Books of 2018 by NPR, &lt;i&gt;Bookforum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt;. One of &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s 10 Best Debut Novels of 2018. An Amazon Best Book of the Month and named a fall read by &lt;i&gt;Buzzfeed, Nylon, Entertainment Weekly, Elle, Vanity Fair, Vulture,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Refinery29&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mind Body Green&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gorgeous, raw debut novel about a young woman braving the ups and downs of motherhood in a fractured America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lydia Kiesling&#39;s razor-sharp debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Golden State&lt;/i&gt;, we accompany Daphne, a young mother on the edge of a breakdown, as she flees her sensible but strained life in San Francisco for the high desert of Altavista with her toddler, Honey. Bucking under the weight of being a single parent--her Turkish husband is unable to return to the United States because of a &quot;processing error&quot;--Daphne takes refuge in a mobile home left to her by her grandparents in hopes that the quiet will bring clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But clarity proves elusive. Over the next ten days Daphne is anxious, she behaves a little erratically, she drinks too much. She wanders the town looking for anyone and anything to punctuate the long hours alone with the baby. Among others, she meets Cindy, a neighbor who is active in a secessionist movement, and befriends the elderly Alice, who has traveled to Altavista as she approaches the end of her life. When her relationships with these women culminate in a dangerous standoff, Daphne must reconcile her inner narrative with the reality of a deeply divided world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keenly observed, bristling with humor, and set against the beauty of a little-known part of California, &lt;i&gt;The Golden State&lt;/i&gt; is about class and cultural breakdowns, and desperate attempts to bridge old and new worlds. But more than anything, it is about motherhood: its voracious worry, frequent tedium, and enthralling, wondrous love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

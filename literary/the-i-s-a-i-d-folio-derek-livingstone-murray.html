  <title>The I.S.A.I.D. Folio - Derek Livingstone Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The I.S.A.I.D. FOLIO is a project that really had no beginning. It is a compilation of works that I have created over a period of time dating back to 1991 when the picture of you was penned.  Since then I have written the charts and other songs, but without funds to record, needed a way to bring the works to light. 
The idea of writing a novella to give insight and context to the songs became the winning concept to which adding the photos became the cherry on the sundae.
I liken the experience of this book to that of reading purple rain or any other such film about musicians.  Entrenched, the novella, is far from being a literary masterpiece, rather a trashy story that provides a utilitarian soap opera backbone from which to hang the music" />

  <title>Funny Boy - Shyam Selvadurai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An evocative coming-of-age novel about growing up gay in Sri Lanka during the Tamil-Sinhalese conflict&amp;#8212;one of the country&amp;#8217;s most turbulent and deadly periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arjie is &amp;#8220;funny.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second son of a privileged family in Sri Lanka, he prefers staging make-believe wedding pageants with his female cousins to battling balls with the other boys. When his parents discover his innocent pastime, Arjie is forced to abandon his idyllic childhood games and adopt the rigid rules of an adult world. Bewildered by his incipient sexual awakening, mortified by the bloody Tamil-Sinhalese conflicts that threaten to tear apart his homeland, Arjie painfully grows toward manhood and an understanding of his own &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221; identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refreshing, raw, and poignant, &lt;em&gt;Funny Boy&lt;/em&gt; is an exquisitely written, compassionate tale of a boy&amp;#8217;s coming-of-age that quietly confounds expectations of love, family, and country as it delivers the powerful message of staying true to one&amp;#8217;s self no matter the obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;" />

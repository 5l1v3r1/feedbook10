  <title>The Nothing - Hanif Kureishi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One night, when I am old, sick, right out of semen, and don&#39;t need things to get any worse, I hear the noises growing louder. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am sure they are making love in Zenab&#39;s bedroom which is next to mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waldo, a f?ted filmmaker, is confined by old age and ill health to his London apartment. Frail and frustrated, he is cared for by his lovely younger wife, Zee. But when he suspects that Zee is beginning an affair with Eddie, &#39;more than an acquaintance and less than a friend for over thirty years,&#39; Waldo is pressed to action: determined to expose the couple, he sets himself first to prove his suspicions correct - and then to enact his revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with characteristic black humour and with an acute eye for detail, Kureishi&#39;s eagerly awaited novella will have his readers dazzled once again by a brilliant mind at work.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Other People&#39;s Weddings - Noah Hawley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Laurie is a wedding photographer who has photographed more than a thousand weddings over the last ten years.  One morning, she wakes up and wonders what happened to all those couples.  She starts making calls.  Some of them are still together.  Others have split up.  She begins a photography project to document what happens to love after the wedding.  She photographs widowers and divorcees, homewreckers and stalkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is still photographing weddings, and at one of them she meets a man who has sneaked into the proceedings.   A crasher.  They share a spark, a few moments of powerful chemistry, and then he&#39;s gone.  Later, at home, she finds pictures of him at eleven other weddings she&#39;s photographed and wonders if his propensity to crash weddings is sweet or creepy.  She starts looking for him at every wedding she photographs.  When she finally sees him again, a romance begins between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through her courtship, glimpses of her past emerge-her own first marriage and divorce, the things she is trying to get over, to get past, that threaten her new relationship.  Her past makes her a ghost at all the weddings she photographs.  Before the book is over, she has to tear down all the walls she has built, in Noah Hawley&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Other People&#39;s Weddings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

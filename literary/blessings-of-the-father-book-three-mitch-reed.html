  <title>Blessings of the Father - Book Three - Mitch Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blessings of the FatherBook Three is aptly subtitled:  The Boys Break Out!  Yes, this is still the continuing saga of Las Vegan billionaire, Marc Morgan; Americas leading Restaurateurand his kooky yet endearing family and staff.  In this exciting episode however, we identify closely with Marcs sons, Trevor and Taylor as their dream of success as musical performers unfoldsbut will this be their time?&lt;p&gt;
We focus too, on the entire Morgan clan as they labor to propel the boys towards breaking out.  Yet, like everything else in this family, it seems nothing attached to any Morgan comes easily or without trial, unintended consequences, or other fodder appearing first.&lt;p&gt; 
The underlying message:  That beyond coming to an understanding and appreciation of the many talents of these twin eleven-year-oldswe get an abundant view into their exceptional characters, as they fight for stardom.  If you devour books on rock bands or the music industrythen read thisand live their storycomeride along with them!&lt;p&gt;  
Here in Book Three, we build on events that began in prior volumes, and now we see firsthand through the Authors original and authentically casual writing style, just how challenging yet exciting, becoming professional performers perhaps is." />

It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality--the black Chinese restaurant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in the &quot;agrarian ghetto&quot; of Dickens--on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles--the narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Sellout&lt;/i&gt; resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: &quot;I&#39;d die in the same bedroom I&#39;d grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that&#39;ve been there since &#39;68 quake.&quot; Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father&#39;s pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family&#39;s financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that&#39;s left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town&#39;s most famous resident--the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins--he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;" />

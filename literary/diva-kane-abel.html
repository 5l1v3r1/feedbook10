  <title>Diva - Kane, Abel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delilah Brown, formerly nothing more than a girl from the hood-wanna be superstar, now finds herself on top of the world and the music charts. Living the so-called American dream, Delilah is proof that all good things come to those who wait. But when this pop phenom is found dead, she only proves that all good things come to an end. There are too many whispering rumors and circumstances surrounding her death, and too little time to determine the facts. Was it an accident? Was it murder? The list of suspects grows as Delilah&#39;s gangster rapper boyfriend is one of the first to be blamed. But, then there is her incarcerated jealous ex-boyfriend. Could he have anything to do with it? Not to mention her envious former group members that she had left behind to become a solo act. Last, but not least, there is her cruel record executive who couldn&#39;t stand to see her in the arms of another man. Just when it seems as though the case is about to turn as cold as the dead diva&#39;s body, her grieving grandmother stumbles upon her diary. The pages of Delilah&#39;s intimate thoughts are just as intriguing and suspenseful as the pages of this explosive novel. Diva gives readers an eye-opening glimpse into the lavish world of a music megastar. It proves, as the old saying goes, that everything that glitters ain&#39;t gold." />

          &lt;strong&gt;She thought she&#39;d never see him again…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But here he was, standing in front of her. Steve . The man Jill Emerson had never forgotten. And he was more than the lover who&#39;d shown her such tenderness and passion. He was the father of her child. And she was going to marry his brother. Stephen Wells felt like he&#39;d been sucker punched.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His J.J.–the woman with whom he&#39;d spent five passion-filled days over a decade ago–was engaged to his brother? And he&#39;d just found out he had a son. He&#39;d never known why she&#39;d walked away, but now that he&#39;d found her again, letting her go was going to be…difficult. If not impossible…&lt;/p&gt;

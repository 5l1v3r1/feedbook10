  <title>My Cleaner - Maggie Gee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ugandan Mary Tendo worked for many years in the white middle-class Henman household in London, cleaning for Vanessa and looking after her only child, Justin. More than ten years after Mary has left, Justin – now twenty-two – is too depressed to get out of bed. To his mother&#39;s surprise, he asks for Mary. When Mary responds to Vanessa&#39;s cry for help and returns from Uganda to look after Justin, the balance of power in the house shifts dramatically. Both women&#39;s lives change irrevocably as tensions build towards a climax on a snowbound motorway. Beautifully observed, intelligent and moving … a carefully wrapped surprise that gets better and better with the unravelling.&#39; The Scotsman A moving, funny, engrossing book.&#39; The Observer Gee satirises the liberal conscience of the chattering classes with uncomfortable perception in this hugely enjoyable novel … her portrayal of Britain&#39;s new underclass of immigrant workers is presented with her trademark stinging clarity.&#39; Metro Maggie Gee is a superb and pitiless analyser of middleclass angst. Elegant, humorous and surprising, this is a classy performance.&#39; The Times It&#39;s amazing how many details, characters, stories within stories, Maggie Gee&#39;s unquenchable exuberance crams into this comparatively short book.&#39; The Spectator An intelligent and satisfying read.&#39; The Sunday Times A masterful study in Africa/UK relations which manages to be supremely uncomfortable without being cynical, and clever without being calculating.&#39; Big Issue The Flood was chillingly predictive. My Cleaner is a calmer, happier novel. Yet a gnawing tragedy lies in the shadows, all the more poignant for the deftness with which it&#39;s brushed aside.&#39; The Independent" />

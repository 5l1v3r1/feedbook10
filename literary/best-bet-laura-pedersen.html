  <title>Best Bet - Laura Pedersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since Hallie&#39;s father died and left behind ten children, money at the Palmer household is tighter than ever. And just when Hallie thought she was graduating from college, it turns out she&#39;s four credits short. A professor needs one more student for a project that will take her around the world, only longtime boyfriend Craig has another proposition for Hallie.&lt;p&gt;
Thus begins Hallie&#39;s great odyssey, for the first time she ventures outside the safety of Cosgrove County and the sixty-mile radius in which she&#39;s functioned for her entire life.  But somehow, escaping home doesnt translate into leaving behind all of her problems, and, unfortunately, not all can be solved by putting her superior gambling skills to work. &lt;p&gt;
Eventually, its time to return home to all the good people who are great at driving each other crazy.  Hallie must finally face the biggest decision of her life.&lt;p&gt;
Humorous and heartfelt, Best Bet underscores the importance of friends, family, and a sense of belonging.  The characters in this modest, but neighborly, small town prove that an ordinary existence made up of small but genuine moments can satisfy a soul thats hungry for life in all of its glories and disappointments." />

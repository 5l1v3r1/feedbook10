  <title>Her Body Knows - David Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fevered storyteller and a captive audience revisit the past together in each of David Grossman&#39;s new novellas, trying to make sense of a betrayal that neither one can put to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Frenzy,&quot; reserved, respectable Shaul lets his sister-in-law, Esti, into a secret nightmare, as he reveals to her his conviction that his wife is having an affair. Along with Esti, we find ourselves trapped in his paranoia and desperation as we accompany the odd pair down Israel&#39;s highways on a journey that reveals a passion perverted by jealousy and self-loathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the title story, a successful but embittered novelist visits her mother, who is in the last stages of cancer. Grossman investigates the powers of storytelling to harm and heal as the daughter reads aloud her own imagined, merciless account of her mother&#39;s love affair with a much younger teenage boy. Gradually it becomes clear that, for all its anger, the daughter&#39;s story and the writing process itself have led her to a new appreciation of her mother&#39;s difficult character, and her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in obssession, claustrophobia, and the need to confess, these two novellas mark a new departure from &quot;a writer who has been, for nearly two decades, the one of the most original and talented ... anywhere.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />

The book contains two novellas, both about the internal machinations of I’d never read Grossman before, but had recently read a glowing review of his latest semi-autographical novel that made me desperate to read something of his.<br /><b><i>Her Body Knows by David Grossman - Goodreads</i></b> | “Frenzy” is one of two novellas (the other one is titled “Her Body Knows”) published together in one volume, titled HER BODY KNOWS, by David Grossman. Shaul, the main point-of-view character in David Grosmann’s “Frenzy”, is a respectable academic, who is widely admired and gives interviews on television about such things as budget cuts to science education (17).<br /><b><i>Her Body Knows: Two Novellas: Grossman, David ...</i></b> | “Grossman is a talented writer—-elegant, even luxurious. . . . His writing is achingly sensual, the humor sly . . . the language is always lush and generous. . . . Her Body Knows should win him a wider audience.” —The Washington Post “Grossman effects a psychological intensity that leaves one breathless.” —The Miami Herald<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Her Body Knows - David Grossman</a> </h3></p><hr/>

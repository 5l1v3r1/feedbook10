  <title>Ear to the Ground: A Novel - David L. Ulin, Paul Kolsby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Seismologist Charlie Richter, grandson of the inventor of the Richter scale, knows earthquakes, and has a method for predicting them. Arriving in Los Angeles to begin work at the Center for Earthquake Studies, a mysterious agency that seems more Hollywood than science, Charlie settles into his new life. His only distraction from work is Grace, an assistant to a powerful producer, and her deadbeat scriptwriter boyfriend Ian.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It&#39;s only a matter of time before Charlie sees the &quot;Big One&quot; looming on the horizon. When Charlie alerts his boss at the Center, he is the one that&#39;s in for a shock: this is exactly what the Center was hoping for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the news leaked, everyone&#39;s suddenly looking to produce the next disaster blockbuster. One of the few scripts Ian actually wrote, &lt;I&gt;Ear to the Ground&lt;/I&gt;, happens to be about an earthquake disaster, and soon it&#39;s plucked from obscurity and given the fast track. But with a little bit of luck, Charlie may just foil everybody&#39;s plans. He just needs explosives, a helicopter, a little more time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By award-winning writer and &lt;I&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/I&gt; book critic David Ulin, &lt;I&gt;Ear to the Ground&lt;/I&gt; is a rollicking visit back to the 1990s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

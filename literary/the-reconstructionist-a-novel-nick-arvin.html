  <title>The Reconstructionist: A Novel - Nick Arvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a gripping novel of secrets and survival from an acclaimed, emerging literary voice, the collision between a budding forensic investigator, his tormented mentor, and the haunted woman who emerges from the wreckage of his past will have fateful results for all.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At loose ends after college, Ellis Barstow drifts back to his hometown and a strange profession: reconstructing fatal traffic accidents. After meeting up with his half-brother&amp;#8217;s high school girlfriend, Heather, he takes a job with her husband, John Boggs, a forensic reconstructionist specializing in fatal traffic accidents whose causes are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis takes to the work naturally, becoming absorbed in the fascinating challenges of reclaiming the hidden truths behind seemingly random accidents. But Ellis is harboring secrets of his own&amp;#8212;haunted by the fatal crash that killed his half-brother, Christopher. Boggs, in his exacting way, would argue that &amp;#8220;accident&amp;#8221; is the wrong word, that if two cars meeting at an intersection can be called an accident then anything can&amp;#8212;where we live, what we do, even who we fall in love with. And for Ellis these things are certainly no accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Ellis also harbors a second, more dangerous secret&amp;#8212;one that threatens to blow apart the men&amp;#8217;s lives and which leads to a frenzied race towards confrontation, reconciliation, and the unresolved mystery surrounding the accident that killed his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like an episode of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;CSI: The Midwest&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;rewritten by Samuel Beckett,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Reconstructionist&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a gripping novel of love, betrayal, and existential desperation.&lt;/p&gt;" />

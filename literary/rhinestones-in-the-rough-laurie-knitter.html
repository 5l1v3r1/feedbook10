  <title>Rhinestones in the Rough - Laurie Knitter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Irene DiBello has left a volatile relationship where her husband decreed that two plus two equaled five and where she knew enough not to openly contradict it. But on a rainy Tuesday, amidst the pungent mix of Lysol and mustiness that habitually pervades the church basement that houses her childrens day care, Irene meets Tess Gergen. As Tess corners Irene with an invitation to her sons birthday party, Irene has no idea that this simple exchange between two mothers will soon change her life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Despite a ten-year age difference, Tess and Irene become fast friends. One night over a bottle of wine, a hidden stash of candy bars, and a few packs of forbidden cigarettes, the women divulge all their secrets about marriage, divorce, and loves. As the two learn every nuance of each others lives, both past and present, Tess realizes that Irene has made a brave journey out of an abusive relationship into single motherhood. Now it is up to Tess to help Irene gain enough confidence to trustanyoneagain.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rhinestones in the Rough&lt;/b&gt; is the inspiring tale of two newfound friends who refuse to give up on each otherno matter what.&lt;/p&gt;" />

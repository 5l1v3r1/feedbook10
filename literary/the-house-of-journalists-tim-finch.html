  <title>The House of Journalists - Tim Finch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the House of Journalists. Who are you and what is your story?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the questions that confront newcomers to the House of Journalists, the internationally renowned refuge for writers in exile at the center of this haunting Orwellian novel. Home to a select group of fellows, the House is located in a fashionable London terrace. But just how stable is this hallowed institution? Julian Snowman, the obsessive founder and chair, sees the threat of dissolution at every turn. Perhaps this explains why petty rules and restrictions abide: men live in one wing, women in the other; smoking is restricted to the central courtyard; tea is optional, but everyone attends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fellows strive to remake their lives, they are urged to share their tales. Epic and intimate by turns, these stories--of courage, tragedy, and shame--become a mesmerizing chorus of voices in search of home. Among the fellows are Mustapha, who yearns for the family he tore himself from when he resisted a coup; Agnes, a photojournalist implicated in a brutal civil war; Sonny, a slight figure with don&#39;t-mess-with-me hair, who describes a harrowing escape across continents; Edson, who perilously confides his story to his writing mentor; and Mr. Stan, who draws on the noxious cigarettes of his home island, despite having been tortured there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one man manages to guard his past: the mysterious new fellow AA, whose secrecy ratchets up Julian&#39;s paranoia. Julian suspects that AA is conspiring with a celebrated visiting writer to bring down the House. In fact, AA is planning something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A world as beguiling as it is disturbing, Tim Finch&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The House of Journalists &lt;/i&gt;is a novel of heartbreak, humanity, and wit, and announces the arrival of a striking new voice in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Wheaton - Joanne Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A year after the early death of his wife, John Davies comes hesitantly out of retirement to take a job at The Wheaton, a senior’s residence. Having resisted ‘getting involved’ for his entire life, John is immediately out of his comfort zone. The Wheaton is a boundary-free environment, and he is immersed in the kinds of sticky matters he usually does his best to avoid. Surrounded by mortality and the ghosts of regret haunting many of the residents, John begins to do the unthinkable: relate to his fellow creatures and reconsider his past. After a life of being a selfish husband and a distracted absentee father, is it too late to try to make amends?" />

  <title>The Kindness of Strangers - Katrina Kittle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a quiet street in the suburban Midwest, a popular, seemingly stable family keeps a terrible, dark secret behind closed doors -- a secret that will have life-changing consequences for all who know them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Laden, a young widow and mother of two, struggles to keep her family together. Since the death of her husband, her high-school-age son, Nate, has developed a rebellious streak, constantly falling in and out of trouble. Her kindhearted younger son, Danny, though well behaved, struggles to pass his remedial classes. All the while, Sarah must make ends meet by running a catering business out of her home. But when a shocking and unbelievable revelation rips apart the family of her closest friend, Sarah finds herself welcoming yet another young boy into her already tumultuous life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan, a quiet and reclusive elementary-school boy and classmate of Danny&amp;#39;s, has survived a terrible tragedy, leaving him without a family. When Sarah becomes Jordan&amp;#39;s foster mother, a relationship develops that will force her to question the things of which she thought she was so sure. Yet Sarah is not the only one changed by this young boy, and as the delicate balance that holds her family together begins to falter, the Ladens will all face truths about themselves and one another -- and discover the power of love to forgive and to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerful and poignant, &lt;em&gt;The Kindness of Strangers&lt;/em&gt; is a shocking look at how the tragedy of a single family in a small suburban town can affect so many. Katrina Kittle has created a haunting vision of the secret lives of the people we think we know best. Through gripping and heartrending storytelling, &lt;em&gt;The Kindness of Strangers&lt;/em&gt; shows that even after the most grave injuries, redemption is always possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />

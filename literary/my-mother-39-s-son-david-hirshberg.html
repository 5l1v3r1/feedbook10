  <title>My Mother&#39;s Son - David Hirshberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The debut publication from David Hirshberg, a top-level executive and entrepreneur whose business acumen and street smarts have brought him great success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author is a highly entertaining and interesting speaker / compelling media interviewer, who has extensive experience presenting both to large and intimate audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Mother&#39;s Son &lt;/i&gt;is a meticulously-crafted novel that is poignant, suspenseful, and humorous, with vivid descriptions and brilliant use of language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a riveting coming-of-age story that plays out against the backdrop of the Korean War, the aftermath of the Holocaust, the polio epidemic, the relocation of a baseball team, and the shenanigans of politicians and businessmen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It speaks to the key issues that confront America today, but has been purposefully set in earlier times, so as to provide some distance from the current &#39;talking heads&#39; climate that instantly categorizes and analyzes events from a narrow, partisan perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story is told by a radio raconteur revisiting his past in post-World War II Boston, the playground and battleground for two brothers whose lives are transformed by discoveries they never could have imagined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hirshberg deftly weaves together events, characters (including historical figures), and clues and creates a rich tapestry of betrayal, persecution, death, loyalty, and unconditional love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The novel entertains with wit, humor, and secrets both dark and luminously incandescent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For readers who loved Philip Roth&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Plot Against America&lt;/i&gt; and Michael Chabon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Mother&#39;s Son&lt;/i&gt; would especially appeal to people who: like historical fiction; enjoy page-turners; delight in stories about family dramas; have an affinity for Boston; are baseball fans; revel in political intrigue; grew up in the 50s; and remember with fondness radio raconteurs like Jean Shepherd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;" />

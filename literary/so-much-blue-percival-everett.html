  <title>So Much Blue - Percival Everett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new high point for a master novelist, an emotionally charged reckoning with art, marriage, and the past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kevin Pace is working on a painting that he won&#39;t allow anyone to see: not his children; not his best friend, Richard; not even his wife, Linda. The painting is a canvas of twelve feet by twenty-one feet (and three inches) that is covered entirely in shades of blue. It may be his masterpiece or it may not; he doesn&#39;t know or, more accurately, doesn&#39;t care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Kevin does care about are the events of the past. Ten years ago he had an affair with a young watercolorist in Paris. Kevin relates this event with a dispassionate air, even a bit of puzzlement. It&#39;s not clear to him why he had the affair, but he can&#39;t let it go. In the more distant past of the late seventies, Kevin and Richard traveled to El Salvador on the verge of war to retrieve Richard&#39;s drug-dealing brother, who had gone missing without explanation. As the events of the past intersect with the present, Kevin struggles to justify the sacrifices he&#39;s made for his art and the secrets he&#39;s kept from his wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Much Blue &lt;/i&gt;features Percival Everett at his best, and his deadpan humor and insightful commentary about the artistic life culminate in a brilliantly readable new novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />

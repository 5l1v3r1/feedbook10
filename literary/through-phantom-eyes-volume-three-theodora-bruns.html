  <title>Through Phantom Eyes:  Volume Three - Theodora Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By 1856, Erik, a musical genius, has spent his last few years traveling with a band of gypsies. Now an adult, he has his own tent designed to take on the appearance of an elegant opera house and he has no shortage of fans who enjoy the beauty of his elegant voice.&lt;p&gt;
The gypsies have set up camp in Russia where the cold air proves bothersome for Erik. After deciding to move to the warmer climate of Italy, Erik overhears a conversation that compels him to journey to Persia instead. After arriving in Persia, he meets the mighty Shah and eventually builds him a magnificent palace filled with many secrets. During his tumultuous first years in Persia, Erik gains admiration and respect from some who believe he has mystic powers, but he also gains hatred from others who want him dead. One man sees something extraordinary in him, and even though Erik has refused to let anyone into his battered heart, a friendship is destined that will alter both mens paths dramatically.&lt;p&gt;
Just as Erik gains political prowess, he begins a life-and-death battle against two powerful nationschanging the course of his life forever." />

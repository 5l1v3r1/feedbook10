  <title>Wedding Ring (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (A Shenandoah Album Novel, Book 1) - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Needing time to contemplate her troubled marriage, Tessa MacRae agrees to spend the summer helping her mother and grandmother clean out the family home in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the three women have never been close. Helen, the family matriarch, is domineering and sharp-tongued. Nancy, Tessa’s mother, appears to be little more than a social climber. And Tessa herself is in turmoil following a family tragedy that has affected them all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, with the gift of time, Tessa’s eyes are opened, and she begins to see her mother and grandmother for the flawed but courageous women they are. As she restores a vintage wedding-ring quilt pieced by her grandmother and quilted by her mother, the secrets that have shadowed their lives unfold at last.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And each woman discovers that sometimes you have to clean house to find the things you thought were lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;

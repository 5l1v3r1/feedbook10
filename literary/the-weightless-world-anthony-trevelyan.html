  <title>The Weightless World - Anthony Trevelyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Raymond Ess is going to kill me.&amp;#8221; This is what Steven Strauss thinks. He also thinks that he and his boss Raymond Ess are on a fool&#39;s errand. They&#39;re in India to buy&amp;#160;an anti-gravity machine &amp;#150; something Steven is almost certain doesn&amp;#8217;t exist, and something Ess is convinced will save his company from bankruptcy. &amp;#160; &amp;#160; It&#39;s hopeless, everyone knows. At least, Steven knows it &amp;#150; and he knows, too, that his boss&amp;#8217;s grip on reality is growing weaker by the day. His fixation on anti-gravity devices is just one more symptom of a failing mind... &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;...&amp;#160;Or is Ess, in fact, as crazy as he seems? &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;As you read&amp;#160;The Weightless World, you&#39;ll start to wonder. This fantastically entertaining debut&amp;#160;stretches the limits of possibility. It shows that when technology becomes indistinguishable from magic, miracles can happen. It shows us our world anew. And as it does, it weaves a tale of friendship, betrayal, and loss that will move the ground beneath your feet.&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;" />

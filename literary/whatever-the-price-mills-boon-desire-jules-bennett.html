      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;As Hollywood&#39;s hottest director, Anthony Price is used to getting what he wants. But life hands him a brand-new script when he gains custody of his orphaned niece. Now he needs his wife more than ever–only, Charlotte moved out three months ago. To win her back, he just has to prove he&#39;s ready to put family before his career.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charlotte doesn&#39;t know if sudden fatherhood will change Anthony&#39;s priorities, but she can&#39;t turn her back on an innocent baby–or the husband she still desires. Is a happy ending too much to hope for?&lt;/p&gt;

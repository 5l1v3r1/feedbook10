  <title>Shelter Me - Juliette Fay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Marisa de los Santos and Anne Tyler comes a moving debut about a young mother&#39;s year of heartbreak, loss, and forgiveness...and help that arrives from unexpected sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months after her husband&#39;s death, Janie LaMarche remains undone by grief and anger. Her mourning is disrupted, however, by the unexpected arrival of a builder with a contract to add a porch onto her house. Stunned, Janie realizes the porch was meant to be a surprise from her husband&amp;#8212;now his last gift to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she reluctantly allows construction to begin, Janie clings to the familiar outposts of her sorrow&amp;#8212;mothering her two small children with fierce protectiveness, avoiding friends and family, and stewing in a rage she can&#39;t release. Yet Janie&#39;s self-imposed isolation is breached by a cast of unlikely interventionists: her chattering, ipecac-toting aunt; her bossy, over-manicured neighbor; her muffin-bearing cousin; and even Tug, the contractor with a private grief all his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the porch takes shape, Janie discovers that the unknowable terrain of the future is best navigated with the help of others&amp;#8212;even those we least expect to call on, much less learn to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

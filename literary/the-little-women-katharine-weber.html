  <title>The Little Women - Katharine Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A delightfully clever contemporary novel inspired by the Louisa May Alcott classic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Katharine Weber&#39;s third novel, &lt;i&gt;The Little Women&lt;/i&gt;, three adolescent sisters--Meg, Jo and Amy--are shocked when they discover their mother&#39;s affair, but are truly devastated by their father&#39;s apparently easy forgiveness of her. Shattered by their parents&#39; failure to live up to the moral standards and values of the family, the two younger sisters leave New York (and their private school) and move to Meg&#39;s apartment in New Haven, where Meg is a junior at Yale. They enroll in the local inner-city public high school, and, divorced from their parents, they try to make a life with Meg as their surrogate mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in the form of an autobiographical novel by Joanna, the middle sister, the pages of &lt;i&gt;The Little Women&lt;/i&gt; are punctuated by comments from the &quot;real&quot; Meg and Amy. Their notes and Jo&#39;s replies form a second narrative, as they argue about the &quot;truth&quot; of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do readers insist on searching for the autobiographical elements of fiction? When does a novelist go too far in mulching actual experience for a novel? What rights, if any, does a writer have to grant the people in her life and story?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ingenious combination of classic storytelling in a contemporary mode, &lt;i&gt;The Little Women &lt;/i&gt;confirms Katharine Weber&#39;s reputation as a writer who &quot;astutely explores the gap between perception and reality.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;" />

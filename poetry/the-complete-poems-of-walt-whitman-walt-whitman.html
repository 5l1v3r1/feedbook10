  <title>The Complete Poems of Walt Whitman - Walt Whitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the first publication of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; in 1855, Walt Whitman was solidified as an American poet of undeniable importance. The poems contained in that slim volume candidly spoke of politics, slavery, sexuality, consciousness, and the spiritual world. His content was as radical as his form; he utilized free verse unlike anyone before, creating a poetic tongue that was unique and personal yet universal and cosmic. Born in New York in 1819, Whitman came to represent the spirit of an American poet. Influenced heavily by early 19th century Transcendentalism, Whitman befriended Ralph Waldo Emerson who would help shape his literary voice and vision. This volume contains the complete poetic works of Walt Whitman. Through his poems &#39;Song of Myself&#39;, &#39;Sleepers&#39;, &#39;To A Stranger&#39;, &#39;The Sleepers&#39;, and &#39;I Sing the Body Electric&#39; we see a poet of great range and endless influence, one who is a &quot;poet of democracy&quot;. Whitman&#39;s legacy is strong, influencing the beat movement, and countless poets of today. His verse is as layered and textured as the American soil he wrote on, becoming an essential part of America&#39;s cultural heritage. This edition of his complete poems is sure to satisfy the curious reader as well as the scholar. Whitman&#39;s poems are as vital and resonant today as ever, proving to be timeless and permanent fixtures of literary history." />

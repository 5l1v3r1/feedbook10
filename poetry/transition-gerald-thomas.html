      <meta name="description" content="In this small book, I try to encompass different moods and experiences. I focus on the things 
that excite me, and, also, on the things that give me pause and cause me to wonder about my 
world. The themes in the series on experience, are based on the human condition: in poems 
like Homeless in Herald Square, and The Acts of Humankind, and inner reflection: in poems
like Escape, and Death. The themes in the series based on communication, include 
everyday news that is distributed through news media outlets: in poems like The News, and 
human interaction: in poems like The Silent Customer. The themes on love and nature are 
based on personal encounters, in poems like, I Still Dont Know Her Name, and a love of 
nature, in poems like These Trees." />

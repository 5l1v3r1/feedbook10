  <title>Poetry on a Personal Note - Susan Taylor Brothers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title of the book is Poetry on a Personal Note. It will have about one hundred poems that relate to church programs, birthdays, newborns, graduation, get-well poetry, retirees, weddings, funerals, anniversaries, family reunions, and more. These poems are written based on personal relationships with family, friends, coworkers, church family, and community colleagues. I enjoy writing all kinds of poetry, so this book will have a wide variety. I love to write poetry for others to help uplift their spirits. It relaxes me as well when I write. This is why I chose the title Poetry on a Personal Note." />

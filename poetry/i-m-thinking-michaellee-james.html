  <title>I’M Thinking… - Michaellee James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;IM THINKING is a rare collection of poems that explores common emotions and experiences that  appeal to people of various age groups, cultural backgrounds, and social statuses. This new book of poetry artfully renders the authors struggles and accomplishments in her unique life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is entertaining, conversational, and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;IM THINKING is rooted in the poets differing perspectives as: a child who was written off by the main stream educational system; a teacher now entrusted with helping children to pursue their destiny; a university lecturer who supported student teachers and a parent and grandparent determined to leave a lasting legacy. Most importantly, this book conveys the heart of someone who has emerged victoriously from the effects of debilitating past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
Strong metaphors and description demonstrate the integrity of the speakers in these
Philosophical poems. Im Thinking  is a mosaic fi tting together West Indian and
English cadence.
 Clarion reviews
Relentlessly optimistic and tirelessly gracious. Her debut collection takes up the
galloping themes of transcending limitations and defying expectations. Inspirational,
exhorting hard work, self-belief, generosity and gratitude.
 Kirkus Reviews
James starts strong, with Reckless Portrait featuring powerful metaphors in reality
verses.

  <title>Who Shall I Say Sent Me - Paul Tshuma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book I will take you to a new level, were you have never been before. My goal is for you and I to know Gods plan for us here on earth. Here is what He wants: God wants to send you to someone in need, and you are the one he wants to send, so allow him to use you. This book has this title because often times we ask God various question and one of the question is; Who Shall I Say Sent Me? Often times, we do not want to be told what to do especially if its a situation where someone has to be told the in its original state. More so, our friends, families and leaders in our Churches; the book at hand draws your attention to a few challenges that we are faced with and I even give Bible examples of individuals who had to accomplish an assignment from God. We read of their lake of faith and fear of what people will say. It is in this moment that we see a brake through when God takes over. &lt;br /&gt;This book contains lots of exciting things in store for you that will blow your mind but will not cause any damage to your brain. My guarantee is, you will be blessed and encouraged. Well, my friend, the plane is about to take off so make yourself comfortable and enjoy the flight.&lt;/p&gt;" />

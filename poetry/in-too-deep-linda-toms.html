  <title>In Too Deep - Linda Toms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In To Deep
When it comes to walking in the wrong direction, we all have a testimony to tell. Instead of loving those that were created to provide protection over us, we find ourselves hating the very ground they walk on. We create a mental prison and lock them up; sometimes for many years. Refusing to use the key of forgiveness to release them so that we too may become free; we aimlessly walk around in silent frustration. And all this because of the pain and suffering one has infringed upon us in the past. Because of our cancerous thoughts we build a stronghold around our heart; and even if we want to release those from our mental prison, it&#39;s easier to find a reason to keep them locked up. You even believe wholeheartedly this is the right thing to do and that God has your back. But thank God for those &quot;on time&quot; experiences that hinder you from staying on Destruction Road and places you on Destiny Highway.  If I was ever going to considered turning back, its to late now, because I am In Too Deep." />

  <title>By the Grace of God - James R. Read</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The war has started. The battle lines have been drawn. Satans time is growing shorter and shorter. He will come at you and your family with all the weapons he has. You have a choice: surrender to a loser, or stand with Jesus Christ, the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are called to be a warriorwage a good warfare. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier (II Timothy 2:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have not been given a spirit of fear. For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline (II Timothy 1:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are called to resist the enemy. Submit yourselves, then to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realm (Ephesians 6:1012).&lt;/p&gt;" />

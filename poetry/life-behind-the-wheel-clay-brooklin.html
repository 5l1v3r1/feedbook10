  <title>Life Behind the Wheel - Clay Brooklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;I&gt; Twenty years now running, uniform is turning gray,&lt;/br&gt;
Resistance to the window not hindering the way.&lt;//br&gt;
Windshield and wipers tuned to living key.&lt;/br&gt;
The road to Bridgeton calling; its tree line speaks to me &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay Brooklin spends the majority of his days behind the wheel of a bus. In his first collection of poetry, he offers a whimsical glimpse into his daily observations as well as his imagination as he introduces several entertaining fictional characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cotton ball highway to an eerie lake house and a misty fog in the early morning hours, Brooklin leads others down a poetic path where he paints a vivid picture of life and nature outside his bus window. Included are silly dillies that highlight an amusing group of characters that include Taylor the Nailer, whose rather hairy wife is a sailor; Gordon Morgan, who steals a pipe organ and uses it as a sled; and Cactus Clem, who climbs out on a limb to see how far he can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this unique collection of poetry, a New Jersey bus driver reflects on nature, people, and his surroundings as the world passes by his window.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Meditations from Washington Square - Frank Miceli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meditations from Washington Square is a collection of poetry recently written by Frank Miceli. The park is a melange of cosmopolitan cross currents. Located on Fifth Avenue and made famous by its historic arch, a tribute to George Washington, it quickly became a front yard for Dr. Micelia place to sit outside, observe people, enjoy live music, witness protests, converse, read, and write. His student years long over, he had stopped crossing the park to attend or teach classes. He crosses it to return home. His active days of tossing a Frisbee with his son have been replaced by hours of sitting on a bench and ruminating about life in general and his life in particular.
These poems are the literal and literary expression of Dr. Micelis thoughts. They were randomly written and are presented in no particular order. The collection covers myriad subjects; some broadly based, others deeply personal. The author touches on the changing universe, relationships, family, romance, nature, art, aging, and his own concerns and considerations and experiences. In some instances, he asks and answers his own questions. At other times, he discovers that, for him, there are no answers. But there are lessons learned. As we read these meditations, perhaps we might also learn something about ourselves.
Through his poetry, Frank Miceli conveys his faith in people rather than institutions.  He inspires us to be mindful, to value each day. Without glorification, he finds the essence within his subjects and expresses his thoughts simply, frankly, with honesty, humor, and charm. He is satisfied with the life that he has livedone without envy or false hope. Now in his eighth decade, he has found a balance of emotion and practicality, wisdom and wonder, pride and humility, routine and adaptation, serenity and upheaval, purpose and wit." />

  <title>There’S a War Inside Me - Deep Poetry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For my second book, I only wanted one thing: To tell the truth. As a poet, I could write myself in and out of any fairytale I want and people would believe it. But what about those whose lives arent butterflies and lemon drops? What would they believe? I want this book to be relatable. I want people to know that there are other people out here who are struggling with their own secrets. Some the same and some not. I want to touch topics that many overlook or try to suppress. A chance to acknowledge the good and bad to life. I also want my followers to get to know who Deep Poetry is and how my life has not been perfect but an overwhelming struggle. Theres so much that people dont know and Im tired of hiding. This is me freeing myself from hiding in the shadows. 
Freeing myself from the pain of my past that still haunts and dictates my current state. This is me growing not because I really want to. But because I need to. As I write this Im in awe at the amount of hardships that Ive endured and now Im here. In this place. In a position in full control exposing myself. Exposing the rage, the hate, the happiness but, the pain; the pain will always be relevant. And Im okay with that. I want people to know that most of these poems hold more truth then one could imagine. This war, it wasnt easy as Ive been fighting it alone. But, I think its over. Here goes." />

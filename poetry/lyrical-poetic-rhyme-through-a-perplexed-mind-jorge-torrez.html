  <title>Lyrical Poetic Rhyme Through a Perplexed Mind - Jorge Torrez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fortunately for me I was able to find my new niche in this world late in life. Where the majority is just getting ready for retirement for me life is just beginning.  An event that lay dormant, but was able to flourish out of the pain and suffering of an illness so insidious it almost took my life away.  It was the life changing event that jump started my new talent mid-way in my life.  As such, I embrace it while keeping my illness (darkness) at bay.  A challenging task to say the least, but am committed to reaping all the rewards this talent has yet to bequeath. As such, I made poems in this book to follow in a similar style as in my first poetry book.  Poems that deliver a message in a form of a lyrical rhyming stanza very much like a limerick. Keeping much of the limerick style format with 16th and 19th century poetry. In all, it&#39;s a glimpse into my world in which I interpret life, which is through stanzas and quadrants symbiotically tethered with lyrical and limerick sense." />

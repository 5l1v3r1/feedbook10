  <title>Homespun Verses by Grandma Pearl - Pearl Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the first collection of poems published by Pearl Williams. In this book she successfully opens windows and lets the reader take a look at some of the everyday experiences of ordinary people. In down -to-earth, mostly rhyming, verses, she upturns memories, produces smiles, relates reminders of spiritual living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearl, who in now eighty-six years old, has done most of her writing in the last twenty years. Her collection compares favorably with other published authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into six selections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;MEMORIES&lt;/br&gt;
OF THE HEART&lt;/br&gt;
FOR A SMILE&lt;/br&gt;
TO INSPIRE&lt;/br&gt;
OF MANY THINGS&lt;/br&gt;
OF THE SPIRIT&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each division the reader will find a mirror for some past experience in his life or a memory of some human experience. There are the invisible ones; men of determination; perfect mothers; childrens pleas; a path to some spiritual places and many inspirational gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will find the humor in Them Lord, the plight of those depicted in Invisible, the emotion in Peter: a story. The collection is filled with verses that will be enjoyed by those who love poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry is songs of the heart. Homespun Verses of Grandma Pearl will keep your heart singing.&lt;/p&gt;" />

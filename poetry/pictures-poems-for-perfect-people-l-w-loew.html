  <title>&quot;Pictures&quot; &amp; &quot;Poems&quot; for &quot;Perfect&quot; &quot;People&quot; - L. W. Loew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a selection of semi-autobiographical snapshots and musings presented as what most would call pictures and poems. However according to their creator, self-described humanaut, L. W. Loew, what they actually are can only be decided by each individual who perceives them.
Dedicated to all people, it proposes that as a race, we are more than highly evolved biological entities accidentally imbued with self-awareness and, that despite our human nature, are perfect just the way we are. What context would allow such a seemingly ridiculous idea would be for the reader to figure out, along with the true nature of the offerings of this book.
Regardless of the readers conclusion, it is Loews intention to convey through the entirety of this collection the timeless messages that no one is ever truly alone and that something brighter is always within reach. This is a book for anyone who enjoys word play, reading between the lines and seeing poetry and art in the everyday." />

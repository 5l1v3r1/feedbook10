  <title>Welcome to the Tinderbox - So&#39;an Loe’m, Noble Essence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poet Laureate, the collected work of New York poet Noble Essence of the Soan Loem fraternity of mindz, hits the literary shelves with flair and gusto.&lt;/br&gt;
Sarah Wyman, State University of New York at New Paltz&lt;/br&gt;
July, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poets are known for expressing sights and desires with eloquence and creativity. Their words outline and illustrate the world around us, allowing others to see the beautiful picture that is human life. Poets are fluent, forceful, and fearless, and they broaden the horizons of those observant enough to stumble upon their brave words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Tinderbox is a collection of observations from a noble soul, on Earth for a duration of time during which the author
chooses to truly shine. Noble does not seek fame but enlightenment and relation to the divine. Born to city life, Noble Essence has seen, observed, and now delivers the realities you seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is in no way perfect; Noble has perpetrated iniquities and sins, just like the rest of us. However, none of these shadows have marred the light that leads to greater, deeper knowledge of self. Regardless of where you come from, the words found herein bridge the gap of mental separation and segregation to a state of connectedness and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Essence was born and bred in the Bronx as a true student of experience and grew as a tulip from the citys asphalt, despite difficulty and strife. Noble began writing to let the lonely knowthey are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />

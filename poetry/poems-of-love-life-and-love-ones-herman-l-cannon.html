  <title>Poems of  Love, Life and Love Ones - Herman L. Cannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He has been writing poetry over the past 45 years and seem to enjoy ro-mantic poetry more so than any other form. However, he has shown the ability to write other forms,including the writing of speeches.  He began writing around 15 years old as a first year high schooler.  By the time he 
became a senior he had compiled quite a number of poems in a tablet.
These poems were written as a result of being in love.  After graduation from high school he shared his poetry with co-workers and friends.  He
has always felt that he was blessed with the inate ability to choose words that expressed his inner feelings. Being told by many that you 
ought to publish your poetry for all to enjoy has been repeatly said over the past 50 years.
This book of poetry will attempt to bring out a feeling of warmth and memories of someone in your life that made you feel special. Hopefully,it will arouse your inner emotions and allow you to reflect on the goodness of relatives,friends and love ones who were instrumental
in making life beautiful for you. Many of the poems depict an awareness
of nature and the beauty that lies within. In many cases the elements wether it be wind,rainor snow has a message for us depending on our
mood. The sky,sun,moon and even the stars depending on your state of
mind can send messages to your heart that could make your liver quiver. Finally,I suggest that you place a photo to the left page of the
poem that you are about to read or you may do it after. I really think this
would give greater meaning and feeling for the poem." />

      <meta name="description" content="So Then I learned is a collection of inspirational writings and poems about various subjects and struggles that young women face on a daily basis. These words of hope are penned to all women, but in particular, young women who are struggling with their emotional identity that leaves them battling with low self-esteem, low self-worth, attracting the wrong men, and feeling unloved and unworthy. These writings represent the personal experiences of the author, acknowledging her inner struggles and eventual triumphs, which led to her coming to know the most powerful person in the world. Herself!
Her experiences, both good and great (there is no bad), has resulted in the understanding that there is a lesson to be learned from every problem and every situation that life throws our way. The key to growth and maturity is to take the time to learn the lesson. Through all the tears, through all the heartaches, if you embrace the moment and learn the lesson, you too can proudly say, So then I learned, never having to walk that path again." />

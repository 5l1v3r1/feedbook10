      <meta name="description" content="I cultivate this habit of writing not only what hurt but also liberal, by understanding that poetry is a pleasure. A good controversy can be greatly satisfying and can teach readers about a plethora of subjects, which won&#39;t be possible by just observation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I feel a great need to practice what I preach by telling in my verse, directly relates to the success. I hope you have enjoyed my poetry. I think you can see that my life has been based on hard work, education. It is these principles that I believe can have the greatest effect on anyone&#39;s successes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As well as my personal goals that have driven me to want to excel in all I do. And try to be a good role model for my families along with others. I come into contact with as well. My life so far is comprised of a wonderful family, great friends, and a sincere dedication to my family, education and work." />

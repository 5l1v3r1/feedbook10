  <title>La Fleur - Jasmine Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;La Fleur is a poetry collection about dealing with love and relationships. This book takes the reader into the Authors personal world of heartbreak, pain, love, and triumph. La Fleur takes place at a time in the Authors life where she was transitioning from being a girl to a woman. La Fleur translates to The Flower in English which is very symbolic for the Author for many reasons. First the name Jasmine is a type of flower; and second the Author finds it unique since flowers need two things two grow, the sun and the rain. La Fleur conveys those concepts. All the pain one experiences in a relationship only to later find joy and happiness. I believe the song by Maze and Frankie Beverly, Joy and Pain put it best when it explains that love is filled with joy and pain. All poems are written based off the Authors experiences. The book talks about some of the things the Author experienced such as dealing with men that very disrespectful and degrading to the point where the Author has to decide to love and respect herself before she can expect anyone else to. You will find many poems in this book based off that concept such as the title, Gypsy Lover 1 &amp; 2 which talks about a guy leaving her for someone else and then comparing her to this woman he had left her for, which is something that the Author has experienced many times in her life. The Author believes that after a while when you keep going through things you become experienced and choosing on how you take or deal with the situation you learn from it and move forward. A lot of people think the idea of falling in love is fun and games until they get in deep and realize the work and commitment it takes to put into making a relationship work out if it is meant to be. Its not a self-help or how to book but rather a biography of the hearts experiences.&lt;/p&gt;" />

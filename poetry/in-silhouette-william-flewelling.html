  <title>In Silhouette - William Flewelling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poems In W. C. Flewelling&#39;s fifth collection, IN SILHOUETTE, present the acute observation of people and nature whose meanings lie beneath the quiet surface of domestic life, meanings only a poet&#39;s sure hand can uncover. John Mann, Poet and friend 
I enjoyed the collection, though I might be tempted to call it &quot;The Dog man, The Poet and The Preacher&quot;! &quot;Assignation of Delight&quot; is one of my absolute favorites. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s here. (Also love &quot;The Old Goat&#39;s Name&quot; -- with its endearing revelation of &quot;Bill&quot;! -- and &quot;Unfolding of the Night&quot; - what a gorgeous spare poem that is!) I enjoy the animal and nature poems as ever. In the aggregate, they capture your sense and sound appealingly. The poems that touch grief, illness &amp; dying are especially effective. As are your poems about children. Interestingly, I find the final poems -- say from the mid-90s to the end -- some of the clearest, sharpest and most gratifying of the bunch. Each one pops. It&#39;s almost as if the book increases momentum as it nears its end. Guy Kettelhack, poet and friend" />

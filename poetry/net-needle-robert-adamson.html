  <title>Net Needle - Robert Adamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Adamson has been nourished for much of his life by Australia&#39;s Hawkesbury River. His poetry praises nature – red in tooth and claw – and celebrates existence as a mythological quest.&lt;i&gt; Net Needle &lt;/i&gt;is his first new collection to be published in Britain since &lt;i&gt;Reading the River: Selected Poems&lt;/i&gt; (2004) and &lt;i&gt;The Kingfisher&#39;s Soul&lt;/i&gt; (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Net Needle&lt;/i&gt; brings together the presiding influences of Adamson&#39;s life, early and late. He casts an affectionate eye on the Hawkesbury fishermen who &#39;stitched their lives into my days&#39;, childhood escapades, lost literary comrades, the light and tides of the river, and the ambiance of his youth. Throughout, he is characteristically attuned to the natural world, sketching encounters both intimate and strange. These are poems of clear-eyed vision and mastery, borne of long experience, alert and at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;One of the finest Australian poets at work today.&#39; – David Wheatley, &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Could it possibly be close to forty years ago when Bob Creeley and Robert Duncan first brought back the news about an extraordinary young Australian poet? I&#39;ve avidly followed Bob Adamson&#39;s work since those days, as he has probed the inner and outer landscapes of his environment with inspirited precision. “Praise life with broken words.” Eye and ear, none better.&#39; – Michael Palmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’“Net Makers” at the end of Part One [of &lt;i&gt;Net Needle&lt;/i&gt;], is effectively the collection&#39;s title-poem… This is Adamson at his most characteristic and memorable: the gritty realism with a lyrical edge; the “hands-on” knowledge of a physical craft; the opening-out into wider implications about people&#39;s emotional lives.&#39; – Geoff Page, &lt;i&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’[Adamson&#39;s] body of work deserves to be on every high school and university syllabus, and in every bait and tackle shop, in the country… &lt;i&gt; Net Needle&lt;/i&gt; once again shows Adamson to be a beneficiary of the more protean aspects of modernism, an emotionally warm and compassionate poet whose scarifying disclosures are never made simply to shuck the past.&#39; – Gregory Day, &lt;i&gt;Weekend Australian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Robert Adamson is that rare instance of a poet who can touch all the world and yet stay particular, local to the body he&#39;s been given in a literal time and place. He is as deft and resourceful a craftsman as exists, and his poems move with a clarity and ease I find unique. He has savored his life, felt it at each moment, and what he has written is its vivid and enduring testament.&#39; – Robert Creeley&lt;/p&gt;" />

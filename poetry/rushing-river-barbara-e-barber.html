  <title>Rushing River - Barbara E. Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when a Jekyll-Hyde, a boisterous bum, and a group of tourists&#39; board a subway car in New York?  Why did a subway rider cry, &quot;Halloween in July!&quot;?  These and other poems in &quot;Rushing River&quot; are guaranteed not to be 
 boring.  Some will intrigue; others will exhilarate and surprise you.  Still others
will tickle your funny bone.  
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, raised in New York, and spent my early summer years at the library reading and writing stories and poems.  Below are titles from poems included in &quot;Rushing River,&quot; and comments made over the years by editors who reviewed them.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
	&quot;The Civilized&quot; - &quot;Seldom do we see a short poem that has:  1. clarity,
	2. intensity, 3. impact - all in 5 lines.&quot;
	 - J.J. Snow, The Poetry Peddler
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
	&quot;Waste and Want&quot; - &quot;Given the imbalance between a glut of food in some parts of the world and the lack of food in others, this poem is likely always to be relevant.&quot; 
	- Florence Trefethen, The Writer
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
	&quot;Ugly O&#39;s,&quot; &quot;Additives,&quot; - &quot;Though short, your poems have a lot of impact on the reader.  Very well done.&quot;

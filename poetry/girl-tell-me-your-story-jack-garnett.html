  <title>Girl...Tell Me Your Story - Jack Garnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As an avid traveler and educator, I have had the opportunity to meet and interact with various individuals from countries across the globe. The most intriguing stories, experiences and anecdotes that I have encountered are the ones from females. Here, hopes, dreams, successes, failures, regrets, passions, tragedies, and triumphs, were conveyed with such unadulterated fervor, that upon reflection, I felt that in some way they are worth sharing. Thus, my thoughts began to center on how to bring these stories to life.
This book is a compilation of some of these stories being brought to life in the form of poetry. Although these poems are loosely based on actual events in the life of the woman/girl, they are imbued with a moderate sprinkling of my personal interpretation of what I have heard and seen. Included are elements  drawn from North American and Europe; to the beautiful islands of the West Indies and the Great Pacific enclave. This book is certainly not intended for therapeutic use, but one for reflection, celebration, understanding and perhaps, healing." />

  <title>Dark Journey to Blackness - Ron Britton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dark Journey to Blackness is about the struggles of black folks ever since my forefathers and -mothers were bought to this country in chains. Nothing much has changed. There is still systematic racism in the job market. The prisons are filled with black men. The unemployment rate is twice as high as whites. The infant death rate is higher than any other race. The struggle is real in America for the African American community. History is never told the way it should be, so I decided to tell it my way. My hope of writing this book is that African Americans would never forget their rich history and legacy our forefathers left behind when they left this cruel world. One of the ways to bring changes is to speak out and educate the public about issues that need to change. America will never find peace until she has made amends for the wrong she has done to the African American community." />

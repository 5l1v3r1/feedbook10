  <title>Not Always Serious - Denis Liljedahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection or compilation of poems and short stories that I mostly made up over many years, usually when Ive been drinking. That should answer many of the questions about the content of some of the material contained within. My wife thinks Im goofy and is amazed that any publishing company would even consider wasting the soy ink to print it, I am too. 
Im a midwest guy (Twin Cities) only because my great grandparents thought that this area reminded them of home, stupid Swedes and Germans. To me, that wouldve been a good reason to keep moving on. Maybe to the West coast, Colorado, Northern Arizona, or Utah. Furthermore, Ive never tried lutefisk and I dont like headcheese. I do, however, like sauerkraut and pork chops with garlic mashed potatoes and rutabagas. 
I retired from the USPS and left my disgruntled ways and a few mangled bodies behind me. For that reason I decided against having a picture of me on this back cover. I shouldve used an alias, dammit!" />

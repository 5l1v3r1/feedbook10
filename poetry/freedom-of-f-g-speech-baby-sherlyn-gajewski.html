  <title>Freedom of F-----G Speech Baby - Sherlyn Gajewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freedom of F-----g Speech Baby is the perfect title for this book, for it is what we all want to be. Its a no holds barred book with words unhidden and unhindered. I am so glad that I live in a country that allows me to have this freedom of speech and that has allowed me to write this book and I am one who is not afraid to use this opportunity to its fullest extent.
This is an author who will never shy away from using strong vocabulary. Some of my thoughts and vocabulary that are used in this book may shock you and make you shake your head in disbelief. This book is not for the timid and shy readers. It is graphic and modern, because that is what we have become in 2013; very descriptive and contemporary. So enjoy what this wild natured mind has to offer the writing world. Enjoy the trip of a mind that is not afraid to speak and put her words on paper for everyone to read. This book portrays a woman of confidence that is shown in her writings and she has written some self- help and healing poems that will turn you into the self-assured person that you should be. That is why I chose the title Freedom Of F---ing Speech baby, because I believe that everyone should have that opportunity to write and speak freely because it shows a great sense of confidence. To me there is nothing better for a writer than writing whatever you feel at the time and if it is uncensored it makes its all the better; and having the chance to make a book of these feelings is one of the greatest achievements a person can offer to the world. I thank you for this opportunity." />

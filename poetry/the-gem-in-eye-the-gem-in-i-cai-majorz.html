  <title>The Gem in Eye / the Gem in I - Cai Majorz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book The Gem-In-Eye was created with you in mind. As it speaks to you, teaches you and learns you to help show you self. These choice words in the book were chosen in particular to reach a vast audience for comprehensive understanding. Stephen Tyler&#39;s book is about the developing psyche of &quot;man&quot; in general; through the eyes of many. It speaks upon issues of infidelity, drama and many other common things taken for granted in life; that we fail to pay attention to the things we really think we do take heed to. It&#39;s all about being aware, not just of self but mastering that does help first. Not all of us are wordy, speak proper etiquette nor listen to think. This is the reason why a misunderstanding, violence or tensions arise. The gem-in-I takes away the cowardness, the ego, the pride, the lies and the untold truths. Being stripped to a bare where there is nothing left to face but the truth of self. Because once you start learning who you are and why these factor in as principles and habits that allow you to be a better you. He used to think that those he loved were going to grow old, die and or just disappear. Stephen did not need to hurt others and himself no more by distancing. Instead, he sat down and evaluated his character and realized who he is and what he is afraid of. Stephen, now a more empathetic person who speaks less and hears more.  Life is way too short to sulk. Not only are we dying physically but most are dead mentally walking. We need care, attention to detail, love, devotion and respect in order to create and innate harmony. Harmony is the gem-in-I&#39;s message to all to ascend. For we may not agree yet we can understand and become more empathetic on situations which allows us to grow vehemently.  May this book bring you a sense of clarity, wellness and thoughts of love for it was created in that purpose." />

  <title>The Cat That Played the Piano out of Tune - Kimberly A. Erb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book of poems that encompasses icons, pop culture, eras, and things I hold dear in my heart. 
One example of a poem is called The Decade That Lasts Forever. Its all about the eighties. The eighties rock and roll had a lot of soul. The music videos were special from the start. Till this day, they remain in my heart. The video games were true to their names. Like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, Galaga, Centipedethey were fun to play. I wished I could have played them all day. The movies meant a lot to me, like Superman, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, E. T. They got everybody wanting to go to the movies. The TV shows like Happy Days, Mork &amp; Mindy, and Days of Our Livesthey were a joy to me. I love watching them on TV. The toys I had were Gameboy, Speak &amp; Spell, Care Bears, Little Professor, and Cabbage Patch doll. They were the best toys of them all. The eighties were a special decade to me. That decade will never die because of the magic it had. It made those ten years of my life not feel so bad. Heres to the eighties." />

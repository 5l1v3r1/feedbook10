  <title>The Poetry of Petrarch - Petrarch, David Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ineffable sweetness, bold, uncanny sweetness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;that came to my eyes from her lovely face; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;from that day on I&#39;d willingly have closed them, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;never to gaze again at lesser beauties.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;--from Sonnet 116&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrarch was born in Tuscany and grew up in the south of France. He lived his life in the service of the church, traveled widely, and during his lifetime was a revered, model man of letters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrarch&#39;s greatest gift to posterity was his &lt;i&gt;Rime in vita e morta di Madonna Laura&lt;/i&gt;, the cycle of poems popularly known as his songbook. By turns full of wit, languor, and fawning, endlessly inventive, in a tightly composed yet ornate form they record their speaker&#39;s unrequited obsession with the woman named Laura. In the centuries after it was designed, the &quot;Petrarchan sonnet,&quot; as it would be known, inspired the greatest love poets of the English language--from the times of Spenser and Shakespeare to our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Young&#39;s fresh, idiomatic version of Petrarch&#39;s poetry is the most readable and approachable that we have. In his skillful hands, Petrarch almost sounds like a poet out of our own tradition bringing the wheel of influence full circle.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>A Journey to Womanhood - Dr. Nicole M. Ford-Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a compilation of my poems since I was a little girl. In 1982, as a fifth grader, my Mother encouraged me to write in a journal. As an English teacher she always emphasized writing and I was able to use my poems, stories and essays as an outlet for my feelings. These poems are precious, personal and they are expressions of me. I was told it was time to share them.
Join me on a trip from being a little girl to a teenager who thought she was a woman and who thought she knew everything. This literary journey of poems starts with me tells my dear Grandmother that she is my best friend. One of the poems confesses my love to my unborn son who is now a man. These poems chronicle my relationships with teenage boyfriends and also my marriages with men whom I loved and hated Read on as I reveal the deep friendship and spiritual bond I shared with the powerful Man of God. Finally, the last essay expresses my joy and sense of relief after finally having my doctoral dissertation approved! 
What a journey This project is a labor of love, of smiles, of fear and of tears that spans a period of over 25 years. Enjoy this time as you travel with me on this, Journey to Womanhood: Chronicles of a Girl Grown up to Soon." />

  <title>Journey to a Healed Heart - Mary Debnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not all About Me?
August 1st, 2011
Move into position
The words that are calling on me
Asking for permission
To assembly
To teach the heart
What needs to be learned
Instruct the mind
What needs to be discerned
Guide souls
Gods eternal kingdom to be earned
What.?
You mean this is not all about me?
God says:
Aaah yes, my child
The right question has finally been asked
You are a vessel
Used for this task
To help others see
The beauty within
That originated with Me
Look past their immediate
Like I ask of you
See the richness inside
Blessings to inherit if they choose
Give up
What they are trying to hold on too
Their way
Dont look at it
As something they have to loose
My Way
Direction they can not refuse
The hearts of men
Turn back to Me
Discover your true worth
Discover true beauty
Discover the reason you were created to be
No
Its not about you
Its for My Glory
Put your heart on display
Many
Are not willing to do
Pour out till you are empty
Allow Me to finish filling you
With the five steps to faith
You have the information
I have instilled in you
Read My Word
Comprehend what I require you to do
Study My Word
My Way will be revealed to you
Put into action
The goodness of God you have learned
Do all these things
Manifestation
Yours to earn
True faith
You ask
I say
Trust and believe
Stay focused and obedient
You shall receive
Count your past
And your present
As blessing to touch many
You are right, my child
Its not about you
Its all for My Glory
For it gives Me great pleasure to bless
Those who know
They belong to Me" />

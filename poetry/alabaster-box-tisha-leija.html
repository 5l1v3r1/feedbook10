  <title>Alabaster Box - Tisha Leija</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;As you read through these pages, and hear my heart, dont be surprised if you see yourself&lt;br&gt; Tisha Leija&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alabaster Box&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry inspired by the events of life. The things that are written in these pages, I believe everybody experiences in one way or another. The situations may not be exactly the samebut no matter who we are, where we live, or what we dowe feel the same things. We have been happy, we have been sad. We have laughed and cried. We have fallen in loveand sometimes out of it. We have made mistakes, we have accomplished goals. We have been blessed to experience life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Mary anointed Jesus with the contents of her alabaster box. It was the very best that she had to offer. Out of love, honor, respect, and complete gratitude she poured it on Jesus. Similar to Mary, I take that which is special to me, and for the same reasonsI give it to God to be used in whatever way He sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Private Stash - Al Ferber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Al Ferber has created a world as seen through the eyes of Gus. Gus is irascible, nasty, haunted by ghosts, and transformed by his loves. Gus shamelessly invites us into his richly textured fantasies to witness his pain, his doubts, and his exuberance for living. Ferbers Gus is a master of the ordinary. He remembers streets he played on and neighborhoods of childhood conquests and defeats. We share his bed, and the inner recesses of his agile, wily mind. Gus fearlessly shapes poems out of scraps of memory and comes up whole for his efforts. Ferber is an original voice and through Gus spins out vivid scenes from a life.&quot;

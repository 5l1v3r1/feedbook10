  <title>Humor and Heresy: Poetry That Sings - William S. Kilborne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William S. Kilborne has been writing poetry, mostly light verse, ever
since he was an editor of The Yale Record. He has had over fifty song
lyrics published in musicals; he believes that Stephen Sondheim
is our greatest living poet. He has been most influenced by Emily
Dickenson, Robert Frost, Ogden Nash, Edna St. Vincent Millay,
A.E. Houseman, and Edwin Arlington Robinson. No living poets
make this list. Kilborne has also made his mark as a playwright:
eight of his plays have been published by houses like Samuel French,
Pioneer Drama Service, Norman Maine Press and The Players Press.
He also has a Masters Degree from NYU.
His text, The Writing Guide, has sold over 2000 copies; he has
been a guest columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; he has
published many articles on education and General Semantics, in
little magazines.
He has been the president of the Yale Debating Society (never
lost a debate); a cook in the Hawaiian National Guard; an
educator (department chair and instructor, headmaster) in
colleges and prep schools; a professional writer (Bread Loaf
Writers Conference), (San Francisco Writers Conference,
2011: non-fiction finalist and poetry runner-up); a Dallas
Cowboys fan; a lover of French cuisine and English Bulldogs,
a widower, an atheist, and a ping-pong hustler. Still writing.
In love. Not dead yet." />

  <title>The Quick - Lawrence Sail</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lawrence Sail&#39;s new collection encompasses a striking variety of subjects. He reflects on the natural world, both in micro- and macrocosm, looking for example at flowers, birds, the sea, the earth seen from space; he explores the intricacies and balances of love and family relationships; he finds new resonances in the paintings of David Bomberg, Howard Hodgkin and Paul Klee, and affinities in his translations of Mallarmé, Rilke and Trakl. His imaginative scope extends into a sequence of prose poems responding powerfully to Gabriel Fauré&#39;s nine Préludes for piano. Throughout the collection, close attention to the physical world is paired with the perceptions such careful consideration provokes. Often this embodies a duality – instances of love carry the shadow of grief; a beached boat evokes the horizon; a book is both an object and an emblem of lost authority; the fragment of a Roman carving suggests wholeness restored. Above all, there is in Sail&#39;s writing a celebration of the world, its preciousness magnified by the ways in which he takes the measure of what appears in the title poem as &#39;all that lasts, / all that is gone&#39;, the juxtaposition of the transient and the enduring. &#39;There is a shimmering quality to Sail&#39;s sensibility which moves easily between sharply focused observations of the particulars of object and place, the play of light on the locally loved and known, and a constant alertness to larger climates and movements...close and subtle looking and a rich, playful use of language are the tools by which discoveries are made&#39; – Peter Scupham, PN Review.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The Course of Our Seasons - Kathleen Gresham Everett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Course of Our Seasons is filled with angelic messages that await only our awareness. Even the mundane is rendered sacred in the fullness of love&#39;s journey. Brilliant, sensitive, accessible...
Dr. Jim Young, AWARE IN A WORLD ASLEEP 
The tilt of the earth, rustle of angel wings and the hush of a lullaby bring the reader into The Course of Our Seasons. Kathleen Gresham Everett allows us glimpses into the seasons of our natural world, our spiritual world and the world of our emotions through her evocative and thoughtful poetry. The inspiration is specific and universal - birth, life, death and ultimately, rebirth.
The book begins with the natural world where Everett&#39;s love of the Ozarks is apparent. We observe the seasons with spring peepers, sassafras trees and the charm of finches.
The second section greets us with Advent and moves through the church year, as we experience the celebrations and stories of faith.
Our interior life is contemplated in the final section. It opens with a lullaby, then poems of family, romantic love, heartbreak, grief and, finally, acceptance bringing us through our emotional seasons. 
This collection of poems celebrates the essence of our world as we move through The Course of Our Seasons." />

  <title>Doors to Paradise - Ajit Sripad Rao Nalkur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Doors to Paradise: Poems for the Soul is Ajit Sripad Rao Nalkurs fourth book of poetry, and it follows his previously published trilogy on love. His poems are an invitation for our souls to discover what lies behind each door we encounter in life. The author experienced intense joy, peace, and freedom as he wrote these poemsemotions he hopes to share with all.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The poems in this collection are arranged in chronological order and written in various rhyming styles. The poems were created as spontaneous outbursts of the soul, and in the reading of them, the author hopes that the readers heart will similarly open and receive the emotions they convey.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Like doorways into the authors soul, Doors to Paradise: Poems for the Soul reflects the peace and contentment in his life now.&lt;/P&gt;
The Muse&lt;/br&gt; 
Forever poised&lt;/br&gt;  
on the brink&lt;/br&gt; 
of a poem,&lt;/br&gt; 
patiently waiting&lt;/br&gt; 
for the Muse&lt;/br&gt; 
to rise&lt;/br&gt; 
or fall&lt;/br&gt; 
from the skies,&lt;/br&gt; 
the poets eye&lt;/br&gt; 
looks out &lt;/br&gt; 
onto the fields&lt;/br&gt; 
of paradise&lt;/br&gt; 
left vacant &lt;/br&gt; 
of her presence.&lt;/br&gt; 
He looks &lt;/br&gt; 
for her &lt;/br&gt; 
in his heart &lt;/br&gt; 
and sees &lt;/br&gt; 
that she indeed &lt;/br&gt; 
is the one thing &lt;/br&gt; 
he needs &lt;/br&gt; 
and wants; &lt;/br&gt; 
a window &lt;/br&gt; 
is flung open,&lt;/br&gt; 
a door beckons, &lt;/br&gt; 
the house of the soul &lt;/br&gt; 
welcomes him &lt;/br&gt; 
home ...&lt;/br&gt;" />

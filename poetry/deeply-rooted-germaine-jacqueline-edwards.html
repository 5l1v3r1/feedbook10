  <title>Deeply Rooted - Germaine Jacqueline Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deeply Rooted is a collection of my works which tell the inside story.
Stories told through the voice of poetry. These works were inspired by tales of happiness and sorrow; love, deceit, strength, courage, friendship and second chances. It pays tribute to those gone but not forgotten and most importantly it is a reflection of the power of faith and love.
Deeply Rooted takes us on a journey that reminds us to live each day as if it were our last. A journey that takes us back to our roots and brings us full circle as we experience todays struggles and our hopes and dreams for a brighter tomorrow. All shared throughout the pages of this collection which is sure to evoke one emotion or another Deeply Rooted within.
My God has blessed me with this awesome gift of story- telling through poetry.  He has given me the courage to open up and share this gift, these experiences. I hope at some point along this journey you too can see yourself. Perhaps youve walked that very same road, although your destination may have been vastly different. If so, then the one thing that always got me through those tough times was true; the belief that you never walk alone. Someone has walked this very road ahead of you or in your footsteps left behind.  
As you turn each page, may you find the strength to endure and the faith to venture onto the next chapter of your life while holding your head up remembering that despite all else, God loves you and so do I.
Deeply Rooted is a gift I want to share with you and may you continue to be inspired long after you turn the last page." />

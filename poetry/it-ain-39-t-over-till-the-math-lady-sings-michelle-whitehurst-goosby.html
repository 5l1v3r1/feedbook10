  <title>It Ain&#39;t over Till the Math Lady Sings - Michelle Whitehurst Goosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Math Poetry, an extraordinary venture to say the least, is my way of taking mathematics to the next level as I see it. My collection includes math applications in verse, mathematical enigmas and teasers, expository math poetry, and a rhythmic math rap. This is an old story that has sparked my interest since childhood. I grew up showered with nursery rhymes and songs. My mother sung numerous nursery rhymes and songs to me and my brothers and sisters as we were growing up back in the early 60s. I absolutely loved it. Since both math and writing are two of my favorite pastimes, a merger between the two was inevitable. As I was enthralled in my writing, I threw in some fascination, imagination, and exhilaration in an effort to capture the interest of the reader." />

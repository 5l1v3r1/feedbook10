  <title>Henry&#39;s Fate and Other Poems - John Berryman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The poems in this posthumous collection were written by John Berryman between 1967 and 1972, the year of his death. The first group consists of forty-five unpublished or uncollected Dream Songs, included the title poem, &quot;Henry&#39;s Fate.&quot; The second part includes eleven short poems; the third is devoted to unfinished longer poems, one of which is the extraordinary draft version of &quot;Washington in Love,&quot; more ambitious in scope and intention than the version Berryman published in &lt;i&gt;Delusions, Etc.&lt;/i&gt;This section also includes the &quot;Proemio&quot;to a poem addressed to his children, which Berryman was planning as &quot;my third epic,&quot; after &lt;i&gt;Homage to Mistress Bradstreet&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Dream Songs.&lt;/i&gt;  The fourth and final section consists of ten poems of the later period, including &quot;The Alcoholic in the 3rd Week of the 3rd Treatment,&quot; and &quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; a poem written within forty-eight hours of his death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Henry&#39;s Fate and Other Poems&lt;/i&gt; has been compiled by John Haffenden, poet and critic, who is at work on the authorized biography of Berrman. In his introduction he reveals that a number of poems turned up in unlikely places: &quot; Old Codger Henry&#39; was found, for example, on a scrap of envelope tucked away in an edition of Coleridge.&quot; He cites a satirical epitaph Berryman wrote on himself as early as 1955: &quot;He was a poet. To earn a living--instead of scrounging as he should have done--he lectured on subjects he knew nothing about to students incapable of learning anything.&quot; He feels that Berryman &quot;embodied in his life the truth of his own phrase, &#39;The happier you get the worse you feel.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

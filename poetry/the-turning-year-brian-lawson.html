  <title>The Turning Year - Brian Lawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Turning Year
This ones for the records.
2009 has been a complex novel,
from the prosaic Chapter One,
all the way to Chapter Twelve,
where I, the protagonist,
is left wondering why it all went down
the way it did.
In the opening pages of January,
how could I have ever known
that in two months time
Id meet the girl of my dreams,
and feel her, touch her in ways
I never thought possible?
How could I have known
that this connection would happen,
fulfilling my urges, yet at the same time
signing the order of execution
on the heart of someone who had only committed the crime
of trusting me?
But soon I lost them both,
left them hating me
and wanting to be rid of me." />

  <title>Sense of Enigma - Jacob Isaac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;For those who have the privilege and the daring to read poetry, the surprise and discovery never end. Such is the case with the poetics of Dr. Jacob Isaac in the twenty-two poems that make up his book Sense of Enigma presented here in its bilingual (English-Spanish) version. Due to my audacity to reincarnate his poetry for Spanish readers, I have recreated them in the Spanish Language and hopefully without betraying them in the traditional possibility of &quot;traditore traduttore.&quot; The creation of this poet is challenging and uncommon.&quot; 
Luis Alberto Ambroggio 
North-American Academy of the Spanish Language 
The author of Sense of Enigma, Jacob Isaac, explores almost all the throes and imaginative possibilities of Fantasy, as it affects the human mind, the inner self with feelings, and even some physical attributes of man. This in-depth poetic report will stimulate the thoughts of habits, amusements, pride, and other sometimes hidden responses when experimenting with fantasy. Its imagery opens many doors and closes none 
Rex B. Valentine - USA 
I am deeply impressed with the skillful hand of Mr. Jacob Isaac in writing poetry. He has powerful pen that can magnify the barely unseen to make it apparent to the naked eyes. He is one of those poets who can touch the human soul by simply saying a word. How he transforms images into reality and reality into images is quite remarkable. In effect, Mr. Jacob Isaac&#39;s writings, are collections of precious jewels in the art of poetry.

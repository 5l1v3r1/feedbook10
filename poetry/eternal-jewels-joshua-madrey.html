  <title>Eternal Jewels - Joshua Madrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am an admirer of the beauty of Christianity and Yeshua the Christ. I wrote this to try to capture the beauty and wonder of love that mankind has for God and that God has for man. The parable of the prodigal son was the one that influenced me the most. The love a father has for his children, despite the childs error, the love for the child will always have its place or mark on the heart of the father. Even to the point that the father will continue to love that child in their worst position of their lives. Also to restore the child to the family with position and honor when they dont deserve anything at all. The love of a father is unwavering and unconditional, most of all seeking the restoration of the loss in his family." />

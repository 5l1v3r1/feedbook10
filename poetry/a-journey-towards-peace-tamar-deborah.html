  <title>A Journey Towards  Peace - Tamar Deborah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been writing since I was 13 years old.  It started for me as a means to express my thoughts, while at the same time being able to keep my thoughts to myself.   For me, writing is something that must come through inspiration. It takes me to a place outside of myself.
At any point in time, a thought, an idea or even a single word comes to mind and the poetry envelopes itself around it.  The concept may take a minute to create, or it could take an hour or moreit all depends upon how strong the thought or the idea may be.   A force so strong within me says write, and so I write. Then, the work takes on a life all its own.
Twenty years ago, I looked ahead and I saw an entirely different future for me.   It is truly surreal to me--because I was looking at my situation at a different in my life and I could not see beyond those circumstances.  
This book is intended to inspire others to trust in a power beyond the realms of what they may see at the moment because they are not looking at an accurate picture of their future.  Dare to dream--to believe that all things are possible to them that believe--to believe in themselvesnot because of, but in spite of circumstances--to view different perspectives.
No one knows what the future holds for them.  They can only imagine.  I encourage you to find that inner spirit then trust that higher power, dare to dream and believe it will come to fruition. 
The journey towards finding that inner peace is a long oneone that people search for throughout their lifetime.

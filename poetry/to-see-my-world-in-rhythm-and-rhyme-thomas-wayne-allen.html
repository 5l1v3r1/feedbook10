  <title>To See My World in Rhythm and Rhyme - Thomas Wayne Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To See My World in Rhythm and Rhyme is a compilation of short poems representing life experiences, opinions, common sense advice, and creative fiction from the pen of working man, Tom Allen.  Many of the featured works are laced with humor, but the reader will also catch a real slap of reality from time to time.  This collection is a very rare slice of Americana, coming from the heart of a man who has known honest, hard work, and the joys and tragedies of life.  Also reflected in this volume are his intimate closeness to nature, and the unconditional love and dedication he holds for his family and friends.
Tom has at long last been convinced (by his dedicated family and friends) to share some of his poetic creations, which has resulted in the publishing of this book.  To read this unequaled collection of Tom Allen poetry is a life experience in itself." />

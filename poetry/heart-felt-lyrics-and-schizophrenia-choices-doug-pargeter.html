  <title>Heart Felt Lyrics and Schizophrenia Choices - Doug Pargeter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My song lyrics and journal reveal truth about my mental health and provide stability, comfort and inspiration. Lyrics are country songs reflecting lifes experiences and treasures.  Suffering and miracles in my life have taught me truth. The secular movement has eroded basic Christian values in mental health. Recovery is possible for mental illness and alcoholism when you understand youre self and how your higher power can intervene. Love can make the difference with paranoia when you know youre self. Privacy is threatened. Never give up hope, always be vigilant Israeli PM. Hitler took over using government health care against the people, will it happen to us? We are at war for our liberty and freedom of religion and also health care freedom.

In my lyrics I reflected on the renewing of relationships. My relationships were stormy due to the nature of the illness but decided to let my wife know I had schizophrenia beforehand the last time creating trust where I needed it allowing her to put up with my paranoia. I have suffered as Job and regained much that I lost and I hope to share my success with the world thru my books and song lyrics which has become therapy to me." />

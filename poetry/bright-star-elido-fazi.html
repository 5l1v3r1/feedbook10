  <title>Bright Star - Elido Fazi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the heels of a renewed global interest in the figure and writing of 19th century British poet John Keats (as attested by Jane Campion&#39;s acclaimed film by the same title), Elido Fazi&#39;s Bright Star retraces the last period of the young poet&#39;s life, as he struggles with financial hardship and family drama. Through a fragmented, non sequential narrative, in line with Keats&#39; complex style and character, the book brings to life the personality of a man who dared to tackle life&#39;s deepest contradictions.
In this intimate portrait, Keats&#39; encounters with some of the foremost personalities of his time - Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge - are viewed through the eyes of a man of humble origins, yet imbued with a unique sensibility. In the book, Keats&#39; struggle to give a literary voice to his powerful vision is intertwined with the tragic fate of the poet&#39;s brothers, and ultimately of Keats himself, struck down by an illness at the age of 26.
In his search for the ultimate meaning of things, even his relationship with Fanny acquired a transcendental importance: a matter non simply of affection, but of spiritual communion. Elido Fazi draws heavily - and liberally - not only on Keats&#39; poetic production, but also on his ample and humorous correspondence, shedding light on some of the most quirky and least-known details of the poet&#39;s life. 
In dedicating his life to a never-ending meditation on concepts which our modern sensibility holds so dear - but which often fell on deaf ears with his contemporaries - such as Good, Beauty and Truth, Keats proved to be a mystical and visionary modern hero, who was centuries ahead of his time, and will be remembered for centuries to come." />

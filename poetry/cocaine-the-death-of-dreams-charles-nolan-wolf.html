you left me to the nightmares of a dark room in an attic.&lt;br&gt;
you left me to the shadows of a ghost I could not see.&lt;br&gt;
you left me there to shiver and to crouch in silent places&lt;br&gt;
when all the world Id ever known had gone away from me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
you left me with a memory and the image of your face.&lt;br&gt;
you left me with the fear of death that I could not erase.&lt;br&gt;
you left me when I needed you when I was only three&lt;br&gt;
when all the world Id ever known had gone away from me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
you left me without warning without telling me good-bye.&lt;br&gt;
you left me without saying that you loved me when I cried.&lt;br&gt;
you left me in the shadows of a child I could not find&lt;br&gt;
when all the world Id ever known had left me far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
you left me for a shot of booze a line of coke but more&lt;br&gt;
you left me in the dark of night when I was only four.&lt;br&gt;
you left me by myself to find a way to stop the fear,&lt;br&gt;
when all I ever wanted was for you to be so near.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and now Im standing oh so tall so daring and so proud&lt;br&gt;
that I have made myself a world where you are not allowed.&lt;br&gt;
a world that is free of pain where little children play&lt;br&gt;
against the dark room shadows of a ghost I cannot name." />

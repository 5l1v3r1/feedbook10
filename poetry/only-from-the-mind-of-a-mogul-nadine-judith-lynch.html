  <title>Only from the Mind of a Mogul - Nadine Judith Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Only From the Mind of a Mogul is Trending on Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New erotic poetry book inspired by Rap music lyricism. My book of Rap lyrics, or, my rhyme book, is a remarkable feat in self-exposition. It is a delightful romp with raw, witty word play of an enticingly sexual nature. This book is fun, entertaining and it can be sexually arousing. Its shock value is to be noted, for it is abundantly and cleverly displayed throughout. I hope to shock, delight and entertain my readers with this Rap book which is salacious, forthright and at times irreverent. You wont be able to put it down until you have consumed every provocative syllable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:3.5in&quot;&gt;Nadine Judith Lynch  New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is relevant in today&#39;s society because it antagonizes thought and conversation about issues that are ordinarily prohibited, even in frankness and candor. It stirs discussion and debate while never ceasing to entertain and stimulate. The book relates to practically every current trend in the news. The sexual dynamics explored within coupled with the audacious manner in which it is presented are what make it delicious to the mind&#39;s palate and nutritious for the growth and development of the human soul. It is unique in that the language is exceptionally and exquisitely explicit for the sole purpose of unmitigated clarity. It&#39;s rough and real in its presentation and relenting in its delivery. It seeks freedom from the encapsulation of humdrum decorum and thus has attained its goal.

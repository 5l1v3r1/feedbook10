  <title>Poems from the Rocky Mountains - A. Albert Aguero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poems from the Rocky Mountains is about situations people experience in their environment as they happen and at different times, using poetic language and imagery. This is not a run-of-the-mill-poetry book; neither will it make me famous. I was told that to be a famous poet, the poet has to be six feet under first, and at my age, I dont want to be famous at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is the result of training and experience as an immigrant, adopting the language, the way of life, and the way of thinking in my adopted country for the last sixty-eight years, never forgetting that English is my daily means of communication. In order to believe the above statement, you have to read my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring the flow of my Indian/Hispanic heritage and sensitivity to the American poetic stream, which produces out of the two factors, the oneness that makes Poems from the Rocky Mountains a unique book. This is why most of the topics in it are as American as baseball and apple pie, but spiced with tropical flavor: goal achievement, the Rocky Mountain landscape, the Old West tradition, patriotism, geographical wonders, personal, family and social problems, abstract and humorous poetry, the tropical landscape, international, romantic, lyrical, child-appropriate, rhymed and metered styles and elegies.&lt;/p&gt;" />

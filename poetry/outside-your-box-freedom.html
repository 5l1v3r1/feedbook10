  <title>Outside Your Box - # Freedom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here we are again I couldnt stop with just Dialogue. Gods not finished. As I told you before, Tte--Tte, was only a subtle boom. God is opening up my heart to spill more. Theres a bit of a difference to this book/journal. It explores the imagination of Art, the expression of pure emotions. So, I use to curse really, really, REALLY bad and although I have an extended vocabulary, I felt that the curse words brought it home for ME. Its not to say, it could have been omitted but I know that God will not send me to damnation over a few curse words and if you have an opinion on it, I respect it and at the same time will happily tell you we all fall short. For no one sin is greater than another. Religion will never have me bound and I understand, love and appreciate the God I serve. He made all of me even the side that cursesthis is another side of my truth but its a tougher side of me that kept me from giving upthe side of me that in the midst of my struggle God let me know He still had it all. It was by sheer stubbornness, will and determination that wouldnt let me quit. I had to continue toward His vision, no matter what came my way. The Bible is our guide but before the guide was written the work had to be put in." />

  <title>Conversations with My Muse - Gary Bateman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conversations with My Muse is a fascinating and compelling new book of selected poetry by Gary Bateman. As a new author, this work is Mr. Batemans first published book of poetry, and with it he brings to the reading public a refreshing and an eclectic selection of many different types of poetry and themes. The multi-thematic variety of Mr. Batemans poetry should capture the attention of most readers who have a sincere interest in poetry. His writings should also be of definite interest to new readers who are just discovering what poetry is all about and its invaluable contribution to world literature. Mr. Bateman brings a distinctive intellectual depth to his poetry and approaches each topic or theme individually with whatever level of commitment, nuance or understanding is required. He has a devout belief in the power of poetry as a most expressive medium for informing the reading public on issues, themes, problems, and life experiencesas part of the continuing human endeavor. Mr. Bateman sees poetry as a mirror for reflecting the very soul of mankind." />

  <title>Ienke the Overcomer - Corina Zalace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ienke the Overcomer is the illustrated story of a handicapped eagle that lives in a raptor center.  The story is written from the eagles point of view and tells how she will not let her handicap define her.  Her story is a lesson for each of us as we face our handicaps in life, to not let our handicaps define us, no matter how big or small they may be.  Corina hopes the book will be a comfort to those who struggle with major or minor handicaps in life, to see them in a different light.  Corina has struggled with polio since age two, and now at 67 has post-polio syndrome, which has gradually taken her from crutches and a long leg brace to permanently using a wheelchair. But she has made the choice to be herself and not let a handicap define who she truly is in life.  Corina has chosen to be better rather than bitter, and all her strength and joy she attributes to the Lord.  She thoroughly enjoys life and lives it to the fullest.  Her desire is  to see  others healed emotionally and spiritually." />

  <title>Flower Petals of Memories - Selaih K. Lewis-Nguessan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perseverance is the foundation of both life and love. True, we have all been misunderstood by friends, family, and the world itself. Yet, we go on, day by day. What makes us keep moving? What stops us from giving in to the stress and pressure?? The answer: perseverance, strength, and the lure of loving again.
Written over a six-year period, Flower Petals of Memories is a collection of one woman&#39;s poetic navigation through life and the importance of evolving but at the same time staying true to yourself. Author Selaih K. Lewis-Nguessan finds inspiration in her philanthropic efforts and her many travels, recorded in this book to express universal truths applicable to everyone.
Her captivating poetry centers on love, enlightenment, relationships, and family life. She composes in an uninhibited, melodic style with an unrefined simplicity that gets straight to the heart of things. Yes, the world will try to get us down, but after failure and disappointment, there is still lovepure and unconditional and always waiting.
After the water boils down, all that remains is the purity of unconditional love and acceptance.S.K. Lewis-Nguessan" />

  <title>The Elixir of Life - Capt. Amrit Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of poems is based on the theme nature ,what it bears today at the hands of mankind. The great deterioration of human values in man in the present times has brought about greater deterioration in the conservation of natural resources, thereby negatively affecting the normal behaviour of nature as we see it today. 
Man, for whom this beautiful nature was created by the Almighty has forgotten the tenets of love and peace. He is at war not only with man but has come into direct confrontation with the Almighty by ruthlessly destroying nature to pose and prove his supremacy and power. In terms as such, mankind has gone to the wild while humanity to dogs.In other words, nature is massacred and humanity dwells not in man anymore but in the wolves. It is high time that man recognizes the need of nature to exist and survive and its greatest elements of love and peace to sustain and protect the earth from the disaster of the doom. In the true sense , if man loves man he loves nature. 
This book of poems has been divided into three parts. However, all the sets pertain to the nature of man against humanity, love and peace. 
Every poem in the soul of its context tells about how man has transformed himself and transformed the circumstances according to his needs and very much against the natural environment which God had gifted for his very well being. Again, every poem has something to give in the end  a moral teaching." />

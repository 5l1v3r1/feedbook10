  <title>The Eighth Wonder  of the World - Jerry L. Rhoads</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Words, expression and relationships give me the opportunity to connect with someone I will never meet. There are 1,025, 109 words in the English language  I have only used 80,182 of those words, in 14,792 paragraphs in 22,987 lines. Some rhyme and or form prose designed to put forth a different way of looking at my past situation and reflect on truth or dare in living our life.
Jerry L. Rhoads, CPA , CEO All-American Care of Muscatine and Washington, 2002 Cedar Street Muscatine, Iowa 52761  
Over the years I have contemplated publishing the poems but always put it off due to a lack of time to translate from paper to digital those thoughts of thirty years past. I have found not one poem dated because they reflected words spoken from my head that focuses on the ideas of times and events that never really change  just mature, evolve and reoccur if you are to have memories that mean anything. Love, religion, war, peace, work and play all are never going to age just the mode of expression.
Today I still have those in 12 three ring binders on yellowing stock and use them to trigger my editing and writing skills into this book. The material is overwhelming since there are about 2,500 poems. Every conceivable word that I saw along the road on billboards, road signs, advertisements, business signs, or heard, etc. triggered a poem onto tape then onto paper. Today I am to converting these to a digital format so I can capture the thoughts and evolve these rough drafts into many more books. 
I have tried to make the organization somewhat topical focusing on the better material, in my artistic opinion  yours will by nature be different and that is the power of the written word. My intention in triggering topics and titles is not unconventional but does challenge the reader to believe I know that much about words and very little about conventional poetry. So if you like or dislike the ideas and use of the English language that kept me occupied over 1 million miles in my car so be it." />

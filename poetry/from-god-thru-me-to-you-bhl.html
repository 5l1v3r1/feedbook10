Is a unique collection of thought-provoking messages. 
Each message delivering its own heart-felt truth that penetrates
to the very core of every emotion it touches.  Speaking comfort to
our pain, bringing healing to where we are secretly and silently 
hurting.  Ministering the very word that we need and want to hear.
Messages that provide a greater understanding of an ever-unfold-
ing truth.  That although our seemingly insurmountable problems
and lifes own issues may appear  to be punitive. When exam-
ined in light of the Spiritual they are actually educative.   
These messages will provide insight, focus the thoughts, and revise
 opinions about many of our all too human illusions.
The truth is  Things are very seldom what they appear to be.
They are generally just the opposite!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

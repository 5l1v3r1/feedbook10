  <title>Poems of the Bronte Sisters - The Bronte Sisters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë were successful poets and novelists in their own right; however, their careers began with several collaborative works of stories and poetry. They first wrote under male pseudonyms as they feared retribution by the male-dominated literary world if they published works under their own names. They attracted attention immediately, and soon after found success with works like Charlotte&#39;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and Emily&#39;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. This collection of poetry reveals the highly imaginative minds of these siblings, who grew up in the moors of Yorkshire and were greatly influenced by the deaths of their mother and two older sisters. Each sister displays a unique poetic voice and style, varying between passionate, melancholic, terse, melodic and symbolic. This is an excellent introduction to the siblings&#39; highly original and influential writing, as well as a wonderful addition to any Brontë enthusiast&#39;s collection." />

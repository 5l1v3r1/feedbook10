  <title>Cesspool of Wisdom - Wendi Bird Barnhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wendi Bird Barnhart strikes again with this collection of twisted delights. She continues to prove her innate ability to twist the endings of her poetry and prose, leaving you wondering what the next line has in store. &lt;br /&gt;- Rev. Dr. Deborah Simpson, owner of Spirit Cove, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendi Bird Barnhart- A poet, a woman of infinite wisdom- Her poems are as diverse as she is. They come from the heart- speak from the soul, wrap you up and toss you about. She never minces words and her point is made. Life is life; the good and the bad. Her poem Refuse to Cease, reminds me of my brain which never shuts up. It is like she has crawled inside my head And taken up homesteading. Her poem Maybe You Will Smile, is whimsical and does make one smile. Wendi has the ability to not only capture the moment, but also the mood. &lt;br /&gt;- Best Selling Award Winning Author Yvonne Mason &lt;br /&gt;Silent Scream &lt;br /&gt;The Last Rites &lt;br /&gt;A Voice From the Grave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, she did it again: reached way back into the dankest crevices of her psyche and pulled out a steamy, swirling CESSPOOL OF WISDOM. With this latest collection, Barnhart takes off her gloves, rolls up her sleeves and boldly lays out the realities of life and the human condition - complete with diarrhea and constipation. Who says poetry cant have a good fart joke? &lt;br /&gt;- Dawn Svovill, author of two contemporary novels, IMMORTAL BONDS (paranormal suspense) and CHASING KID ROCK (commercial, redneck fiction) and a short story contributor to two BeanPods Press anthologies, BIOHAZARD 2012 and FIRST LOVE. All her work is available on Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;" />

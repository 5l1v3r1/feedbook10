  <title>Poetry of Emotions - Sanydee Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about pain, and love, sex, and tears.  Poetry comes from the soul of a person, and not just words.  You have to feel it to speak it.  The poems in this book will make you laugh, cry, scream and maybe have an orgasm.  Each poem is a part of me, whether it is good or bad.  From Mother, Mother, Mother to Wasted I write how I feel at that particular moment.  My life has been a struggle with relationships and I have learned to make a change.  I hope that this book will brighten up someone day.
Bright light, dark night the reflection of my soul
Candle light, brightens the night my soul is now so cold
Dem light, closes the night my soul is out of place
No light, black night my soul now hides my face.
